Serpent or claw or root or vulture's talon, what difference does it make. And\\nwithout formulating anything clearly, I understood that I had found the key to Existence, the key to my\\nNauseas, to my own life. In fact, all that I could grasp beyond that returns to this fundamental\\nabsurdity. Absurdity: another word; I struggle against words; down there I touched the thing. But I\\nwanted to fix the absolute character of this absurdity here. A movement, an event in the tiny coloured\\nworld of men is only relatively absurd: by relation to the accompanying circumstances. A madman's\\nravings, for example, are absurd in relation to the situation in which he finds himself, but not in\\nrelation to his delirium. But a little while ago I made an experiment with the absolute or the absurd.\\nThis root—there was nothing in relation to which it was absurd. Oh, how can I put it in words?\\nAbsurd: in relation to the stones, the tufts of yellow grass, the dry mud, the tree, the sky, the green\\nbenches. Absurd, irreducible; nothing—not even a profound, secret upheaval of nature—could\\nexplain it. Evidently I did not know everything, I had not seen the seeds sprout, or the tree grow. But\\nfaced with this great wrinkled paw, neither ignorance nor knowledge was important: the world of\\nexplanations and reasons is not the world of existence. A circle is not absurd, it is clearly explained by\\nthe rotation of a straight segment around one of its extremities. But neither does a circle exist. This\\nroot, on the other hand, existed in such a way that I could not explain it. Knotty, inert, nameless, it\\nfascinated me, filled my eyes, brought me back unceasingly to its own existence. In vain to repeat:\\n\"This is a root\"—it didn't work any more. I saw clearly that you could not pass from its function as a\\nroot, as a breathing pump, *to that*, to this hard and compact skin of a sea lion, to this oily, callous,\\nheadstrong look. The function explained nothing: it allowed you to understand generally that it was a\\nroot, but not *that one* at all. This root, with its colour, shape, its congealed movement, was . . . below\\nall explanation. Each of its qualities escaped it a little, flowed out\\nof it, half solidified, almost became a thing; each one was *In the way* in the root and the whole stump\\nnow gave me the impression of unwinding itself a little, denying its existence to lose itself in a\\nfrenzied excess. I scraped my heel against this black claw: I wanted to peel off some of the bark. For\\nno reason at all, out of defiance, to make the bare pink appear absurd on the tanned leather: to *play*\\nwith the absurdity of the world. But, when I drew my heel back, I saw that the bark was still black.\\nBlack? I felt the word deflating, emptied of meaning with extraordinary rapidity. Black? The root\\n*was not* black, there was no black on this piece of wood—there was . . . something else: black, like the\\ncircle, did not exist. I looked at the root: was it *more than* black or *almost* black? But I soon stopped\\nquestioning myself because I had the feeling of knowing where I was. Yes, I had already scrutinized\\ninnumerable objects, with deep uneasiness. I had already tried—vainly—to think something *about*\\nthem: and I had already felt their cold, inert qualities elude me, slip through my fingers.</td>\n",

       "12  I just want a NES Classic Controller since I already have most of the games on Wii / Wii U Virtual Console, and would also like to use it for SMM. It's disturbing and should be outright illegal for people to be selling these at over a 1000% markup - asking $100+ for a $10 controller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "14  I agree that the consistant position is to support all the way through, and I think that if you were going to do that government support is the best (most reliable) way to provide.\\n\\nBut the nuance that they try to wedge in is \"charities will pick up the slack.\"  If they actually DID pick up the slack, I think it would be a reasonable thing for the child growing up (money is money.)  \\n\\nBut charity is fickle and not NEARLY enough money.\\n\\nSide note: I've actually had quite religious people tell me with a straight face that it's better for the government to step out because they are hogging all of the opportunities to be a good person.  As though poor people were just brownie point farms.

       "33  As opposed to INTP? Definitely. And the way you've put yourself out there seems to confirm it. \\n\\nThe only problem is that my Ni judges types based on mannerisms (e.g. eye movement, not just eye appearance) if that makes sense?

I do this by turning off all technology and distancing myself from all sources of high information - words, voices, etc. I then stop, breathe slowly, and just focus on sensory inputs - sounds, colors, the breeze, emotions\\n\\nI recently found an interesting excerpt by Sartre exploring this:\\n\\n&gt;The word absurdity is coming to life under my pen; a little while ago, in the garden, I couldn't find it,\\nbut neither was I looking for it, I didn't need it: I thought without words, *on* things, *with* things.\\nAbsurdity was not an idea in my head, or the sound of a voice, only this long serpent dead at my feet,\\nthis wooden serpent. Serpent or claw or root or vulture's talon, what difference does it make. And\\nwithout formulating anything clearly, I understood that I had found the key to Existence, the key to my\\nNauseas, to my own life. In fact, all that I could grasp beyond that returns to this fundamental\\nabsurdity. Absurdity: another word; I struggle against words; down there I touched the thing. But I\\nwanted to fix the absolute character of this absurdity here. A movement, an event in the tiny coloured\\nworld of men is only relatively absurd: by relation to the accompanying circumstances. A madman's\\nravings, for example, are absurd in relation to the situation in which he finds himself, but not in\\nrelation to his delirium. But a little while ago I made an experiment with the absolute or the absurd.\\nThis root—there was nothing in relation to which it was absurd. Oh, how can I put it in words?\\nAbsurd: in relation to the stones, the tufts of yellow grass, the dry mud, the tree, the sky, the green\\nbenches. Absurd, irreducible; nothing—not even a profound, secret upheaval of nature—could\\nexplain it. Evidently I did not know everything, I had not seen the seeds sprout, or the tree grow. But\\nfaced with this great wrinkled paw, neither ignorance nor knowledge was important: the world of\\nexplanations and reasons is not the world of existence. A circle is not absurd, it is clearly explained by\\nthe rotation of a straight segment around one of its extremities. But neither does a circle exist. This\\nroot, on the other hand, existed in such a way that I could not explain it. Knotty, inert, nameless, it\\nfascinated me, filled my eyes, brought me back unceasingly to its own existence. In vain to repeat:\\n\"This is a root\"—it didn't work any more. I saw clearly that you could not pass from its function as a\\nroot, as a breathing pump, *to that*, to this hard and compact skin of a sea lion, to this oily, callous,\\nheadstrong look. The function explained nothing: it allowed you to understand generally that it was a\\nroot, but not *that one* at all. This root, with its colour, shape, its congealed movement, was . . . below\\nall explanation. Each of its qualities escaped it a little, flowed out\\nof it, half solidified, almost became a thing; each one was *In the way* in the root and the whole stump\\nnow gave me the impression of unwinding itself a little, denying its existence to lose itself in a\\nfrenzied excess. I scraped my heel against this black claw: I wanted to peel off some of the bark. For\\nno reason at all, out of defiance, to make the bare pink appear absurd on the tanned leather: to *play*\\nwith the absurdity of the world. But, when I drew my heel back, I saw that the bark was still black.\\nBlack? I felt the word deflating, emptied of meaning with extraordinary rapidity. Black? The root\\n*was not* black, there was no black on this piece of wood—there was . . . something else: black, like the\\ncircle, did not exist. I looked at the root: was it *more than* black or *almost* black? But I soon stopped\\nquestioning myself because I had the feeling of knowing where I was. Yes, I had already scrutinized\\ninnumerable objects, with deep uneasiness. I had already tried—vainly—to think something *about*\\nthem: and I had already felt their cold, inert qualities elude me, slip through my fingers.   \n",

       "43  The prospect of a wedding and the fact that everyone expects it both infuriates me and depresses me\\n\\nWhat drives me more over the top is that if I ever decided to marry anyone I'd have to deal with my somehow innate dislike of all things wedding/ ceremony related. Hopefully I marry to someone with the same attitude towards it as I have.\\n\\nLike seriously, I'd love to just have a ceremony where the only people who show up are me, wife, priest guy, and a passed out drunk hobo. Then stomp rats afterwards in an alley to celebrate.

You know when the Clone Army was ordered to suddenly turn on and eliminate their unsuspecting Jedi allies? The Jedi Counsel was working with the Republic against the Separatists and all of the sudden it was the Republic and the Separatists against the Jedi. Luke was training some Padawans and I'm going to go ahead and assume this was a time of peace before the First Order came into significant power.  Not the same situation.\\n\\n&amp;gt;I understand why he would come to the conclusion that the Jedi must end.\\n\\nForce-sensitivity isn't just going to go away because the Jedi no longer train each other.

It's insulting to his talent, the person that designed the original, and the person that got the original. \\n\\nI give him examples of what I want and tell him what I like about the design.  He then comes back with something just as awesome but obviously different.  \\n\\nIt's also kind of known that a good artist won't copy a design, they'll at least change it a bit..He does this in Girls very well..Episodes IV-VI maybe are about empathy and apathy?\\n\\nEpisodes VII-IX seem to be about selflessness and selfishness?.Or at least ANY established character..There is talk that the big 3 will be ending leasing in the next few years because they are losing money in the long-run.  \\n\\nAt the end of your lease the leasing company gets your turn-in because they technically own it, unless you want to buy it.  They then sell the vehicle - usually at auction to other dealerships as a used car.  \\n\\nAs for accidents, if your vehicle is totaled, GAP insurance covers the remainder of the loan and that coverage is built into your contract.  Leasing companies require full coverage so any accidents must be repaired prior to turn-in or you are charged.\\n\\nSource:  I work at a dealership.</td>\n",

But it would be really cool to see this come to life..Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Godfather by Mario Puzo, 1984 by George Orwell, and The Death of Ivan Ilyich by Leo Tolstoy. .I think with Syndicate's system, we could easily have a game where you could play as both Connor and Arno, Connor being the more combat oriented one, and Arno focusing more on stealth..&amp;gt;Also, there are people like myself who are disappointed in the overall handling of the overarching story as of this moment.\\n\\nSame. Part of it for me is the story is too scattered. Between novels, comics, and audio conversations that have to be unlocked via collectibles, I have a hard time keeping up with what's going on. We need an anchor, a new modern day protagonist..A few of my headcanons are that Aita is the Father of Understanding, Cain was the first activated/awoken Sage, and Adam and Eve's third son, Seth, hunted down Cain..Wow this is really cool! Thanks for sharing this! .Comes with the territory, it seems..ADHD is often co-morbid with other mental health issues such as depression. I myself have ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and have been seeing a psychotherapist for dealing with these issues, as well as a psychiatrist for Adderall and Prozac. I recommend seeing someone if you can, maybe starting with the counselling services at your school. Talking with someone can help disentangle what you're experiencing, help lead you on the right path to getting the help you need, and lets you know you don't have to struggle through this on your own.  .I hated the pacing at the end of Origins. They should've had Bayek going through two interconnected journeys throughout the game. The first would be Bayek's journey of vengence and learning to let go of Khemu, basically what we got in Origins. And the second one should've been Bayek rediscovering or laying the foundations of the Hidden Ones. The big change for the second one from Origins would be it occurred throughout the game, like Altair learning from his targets as he progressed through the story, or Ezio learning from different Assassin teachers in ACII. It should've been a parallel progression that unfolded along side Bayek's vengeance. That would've at least solved some of the pacing problems. .When was freerunning instilled in one's DNA? That was never the case. It's primarily tied to Eagle Vision.\\n\\nAnd how can one access an ideal or Creed in one's DNA if one doesn't have an Animus? How can Bayek tap into this Creed in the middle of the 1st century BCE?.That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.According to the wiki, they're two different people:\\n\\n[Black Flag Employee](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Abstergo_Entertainment_research_analyst)\\n\\n[Rogue Employee](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Helix_research_analyst).Yep, from elementary through middle school, though it was never physical. One coping mechanism I developed was just trying my hardest to be invisible, which included not sharing much about myself. Honestly, if I wasn't bullied I'm not sure if I would be an INFJ. .Thanks. What you did for that kid was incredible, and I'm sure his life is exponentially better because of your efforts. I'm just glad I was able to use my experience to actually help people and point them in the right direction. \\n\\nI'm sorry about the stigma your family has. My parents were very much the same when I started talking about my mental health issues and wanting to see a therapist. They've gotten a lot better, but it hasn't been easy, nor do they fully understand the impact and effects it has on people's lives. It helps that I have a degree in neuroscience, so I do know some things. Keep trying and keep supporting your sister. I hope everything works out well for her. .Yeah, I miss the depth and complexity that the lore had. But it seems fewer and fewer people care about it, and Ubisoft doesn't really care at all..&amp;gt; My historic assassin character can't change events, they're in the past, and I'm just following a predetermined path. Whatever the outcome, it already happened hundreds of years ago.\\n\\nThis was one of the reasons why I had a hard time liking Edward's story in Black Flag, since we already knew what would happen to him and his family down the line. It didn't matter how much his character changed, he was just going to end up dead and his son was going to become a Templar. \\n\\n.Do you have any sources on this? (Genuinely curious).But according to /u/Thunder_54:\\n\\n&amp;gt;As such, all this to say we can logically exclude INFJs from having Fi.\\n\\nDid I just misread or misinterpret something?.Yup, definitely not a fan of the guy; his views were misogynistic and anti-Semitic. He always struck me as being neurotic or having some unresolved issues that bled into his theology. \\n\\nThere is a \"strand\" of Christians that play down or outright reject Paul's teachings, and focus more on what Jesus said and did.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuism.&amp;gt;This is what AC always was to me, I thoroughly enjoy shoot em ups and fighting games but AC has had a fantastic story with, what I believe to be it's real strength, an incite into philosophy and to a certain extent politics.\\n\\nSame :)\\n\\n&amp;gt;Cracking concepts for books, ideologies and movies but unfortunately aren't as impactful in video games\\n\\nWhy not? The BioShock series is, IMO, an excellent example of incorporating philosophy and politics into video games. And I'm sure there are others that do the same..Philosophy: I got into AC late, just before IV:BF came out. I played Brotherhood at a friend's house, which motivated me to buy a PS3 and every AC game that came out. Prior to this I had read several books on Existentialism (still do). While I was playing through the games, I noticed that the Assassins' philosophy was basically Existentialism in a video game. The fact that AC delved into philosophy and the central conflict was an ideological one made me go from \"These are great video games, I like 'em!\" to \"These are like serious works of art. I love these!\" But a lot of those feelings have changed recently.\\n\\nMusic: One of the things that captivated me from when I first played Brotherhood was the music. It wasn't just atmospheric, it was beautiful. I miss Jesper Kyd :(.That's fair. I'm not going to tell you how you should enjoy these games. But I feel that people who play these games simply to play a video game are like people who watch Lord of the Rings movies just for the battle scenes and beautiful settings. You don't have to care about the lore, the history of Middle-earth, or the universe that Tolkien built, but it's there and it's integral to the identity of what he created. And people are are going to discuss, speculate, and nerd out about the lore. Same with AC's lore and gameplay fundamentals. .He completely contradicts the \"create your own Odyssey\" gimmick, I love it!.It's sad because it's true :(.I also won't be getting Odyssey. Maybe I'll get the next game if Ubisoft pulls off a miracle, but I doubt it'll happen..&amp;gt;...just because they didn't have an official creed or brotherhood doesn't make them any less of an assassin.\\n\\nI disagree. In the AC world, an Assassin isn't synonymous with an assassin in real life. An AC Assassin isn't just someone who kills, they're someone who is part of the Brotherhood and a follower of the Creed. Taking these away removes what makes an Assassin different from a hired killer. And it's not enough to just kill in the name of freedom. By that definition, the anti-Ptolemy rebels, and Gamilat and his soldiers all count as Assassins, which seems incorrect..We just need to voice our criticisms with our wallets..Thanks. I put a lot of effort into it because I wanted to make sure that people understood what I'm talking about, and knew that my statements are grounded in lore..What the heck is question 3 asking? \"accident/randomness as your basis for one's mental life\"???.Black Flag is when they started this annoying trend. .&amp;gt;But honestly, i don't know why is it so hard for them to make a good modern day section so that everyone wouldn't complain\\n\\nThis right here is the main problem, because there will always be some subset of the people who dislike decision X, and will be very vocal about it. If you keep MD, you piss off these players. If you phase out MD, you piss off this other group of players. \\n\\nRegarding MD, the two groups arguing over MD are casual players who are looking for fun gameplay or to experience a certain historical time period, and those that are more invested in the lore and themes of the AC universe. The former group disliked Desmond and MD from the get go, and it seems to me they were bolstered by a wave of casual players who started playing AC at IV:BF. This is like watching the LotR from middle of the Two Towers; you miss a lot of important build-up and background info. But that didn't matter because IV:BF was a *fun* game, never mind it butchered MD with the floating tablet, etc. But these players don't care about MD, or Desmond. They just want to sail the high seas and run around historical settings killing people. \\n\\nSo someone at Ubisoft decided they were going to dumb down the story elements to make AC more appealing to the casual player to draw-in more of them, thereby making more $$. The problem with that is AC goes from world-building and story-telling to becoming another annual release game like CoD or Madden. The style and gameplay may change from year to year, but the substance stays the same, and becomes shallow and stale. \\n\\nAs someone who is more invested in the AC universe and lore, what I think they should've done is stuck with the story. You can't appeal to everyone, so you take what criticism is constructive and you stick with your project, adjusting as needed. But to help newer players catch-up, the ones that started at IV:BF, they could've remastered or remade the first game, updating the graphics and controls, and maybe tweaked it to cut down on the repetitiveness. This would've given newer players a chance to catch-up on the story without needing to revert to an older console. \\n\\nBut ultimately we **need** Modern Day. We need something that ties the games together beyond gameplay similarity and style. We need it to create a sense of progression so that we the players feel like we're moving forward with something and that what we do matters. I was ultimately disappointed with how MD in Origins was anti-climatic, but I'm glad we at least have a new MD protagonist with a *name* and a *face*. Baby steps in the right direction. I hope in the next game Ubi figures out two things: \\n\\n1. MD story direction. Who are we the players, as Layla Hassan, fighting against? Is it the Templars? The Instruments of the First Will? Some other unknown threat? Whatever they decide, they need to pick someone and stick with it. They shouldn't introduce something new if they aren't going to finish the story line in the games. \\n\\n2. Use Layla's newbie status to give us a crash course. Because Layla is fairly new in the Assassin-Templar conflict, it would make sense that there is a lot she doesn't know and needed to be filled in on. I would love to see Layla work with William, Shaun, and Rebecca to learn about some AC lore and what happened in previous games, learn about the current status of the Assassin-Templar war, and go through some Assassin training. This would fill-in newer players with some major plot points, establish what the current MD goal is, and give Layla, and by extension us the players, a greater role in shaping how the story unfolds. Heck, if they could pull it off, I think it would be neat if Layla became the torch-bearer for Desmond's legacy. .I'm glad I was able to give some hope, even a little bit. I know how difficult and hopeless it can feel. And I wouldn't worry too much about the time frame. Everyone is different, and so the best treatment for each person is going to be a little bit different. It could take you a much shorter time period..And what does an earlier, unrefined version of the Creed look like?.&amp;gt;  Whether you find purpose in making a better world for your kids, your friends kids, yourself or even other species: doesn't matter.\\n\\nThis is definitely where I find my purpose. To try to make the world a better place. \\n\\nI don't know if you know this already, but if you find this interesting, I'd recommend looking into existentialism. It's where I find a lot my inspiration..Cool, thanks for being civil and understanding.&amp;gt;Just because INFJs tend to be incredibly empathetic and take others' emotions on as their own shouldn't mean they're therefore incapable of knowing what their own emotions are. I, personally, am extremely in touch with my own emotions. I just usually have a hard time knowing what to DO with them. \\n\\nRight, I thought that just because you have a better grasp on how you feel about something didn't mean that you all of a sudden put your feelings as a priority above everyone else's, nor that you suddenly lost your ability to empathize with people. \\n\\nP.S. You should keep your comment as is. It's perfectly fine the way it is. :).I was just gonna post this!\\n\\nEdit: Another fun fact: She's dead! :D.A historical FPS! /s</td>\n",

       "1  You'd think it would be that easy... And it would be if people would outright purchase cars in cash.  Instead we get loans or lease so you have all these requirements the customer needs to meet in order to follow the law and agreement between the consumer and the bank.\\n\\nThe dealership runs OFAC, red flags (fraud alert for those trying to purchase a car with stolen identity), and makes sure you have full coverage insurance to get an auto loan (in my state anyway).  Then there's state paperwork like title transfer, etc.  \\n\\nSource:  I work at a dealership.  .Red Grape Wine Mad Dog 20/20 &amp; Pepsi \\n\\nGreen Apple Pucker &amp; Sprite .Getting mine hurt like a motherfucker AND it didn't work AND I got an episiotomy.  \\n\\nNeedless to say, I have only one kid..This is why I don't have health insurance - just dental.  That's $10220/year out-of-pocket.  You're better off paying cash..Diet Dr. Pepper alllll day. .&gt;And so Luke does the only thing he can do. He leaves. Which, by the way, is exactly what Yoda did at the end of the prequels. \\n\\nObi Wan and Yoda were in hiding because of Order 66. You know when the Clone Army was ordered to suddenly turn on and eliminate their unsuspecting Jedi allies? The Jedi Counsel was working with the Republic against the Separatists and all of the sudden it was the Republic and the Separatists against the Jedi. Luke was training some Padawans and I'm going to go ahead and assume this was a time of peace before the First Order came into significant power.  Not the same situation.\\n\\n&gt;I understand why he would come to the conclusion that the Jedi must end.\\n\\nForce-sensitivity isn't just going to go away because the Jedi no longer train each other.  It's not a weapon of mass destruction, it's a gift one is born with that the Jedi recognize must be harnessed and controlled.  It would be irresponsible not to..You and the community will always have my support, brother. ��.I see tattoos that I would love to have on me but I know better than to ask my artist to give me an exact copy.  It's insulting to his talent, the person that designed the original, and the person that got the original. \\n\\nI give him examples of what I want and tell him what I like about the design.  He then comes back with something just as awesome but obviously different.  \\n\\nIt's also kind of known that a good artist won't copy a design, they'll at least change it a bit..He does this in Girls very well..Episodes IV-VI maybe are about empathy and apathy?\\n\\nEpisodes VII-IX seem to be about selflessness and selfishness?.Or at least ANY established character..There is talk that the big 3 will be ending leasing in the next few years because they are losing money in the long-run.  \\n\\nAt the end of your lease the leasing company gets your turn-in because they technically own it, unless you want to buy it.  They then sell the vehicle - usually at auction to other dealerships as a used car.  \\n\\nAs for accidents, if your vehicle is totaled, GAP insurance covers the remainder of the loan and that coverage is built into your contract.  Leasing companies require full coverage so any accidents must be repaired prior to turn-in or you are charged.\\n\\nSource:  I work at a dealership.

       "2  Meiji Era Japan. Remnants of feudal Japan meet the industrial West. http://imgur.com/gallery/hEjpl\\n\\nEdit: This is unofficial concept art. But it would be really cool to see this come to life..Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Godfather by Mario Puzo, 1984 by George Orwell, and The Death of Ivan Ilyich by Leo Tolstoy. .I think with Syndicate's system, we could easily have a game where you could play as both Connor and Arno, Connor being the more combat oriented one, and Arno focusing more on stealth..&gt;Also, there are people like myself who are disappointed in the overall handling of the overarching story as of this moment.\\n\\nSame. Part of it for me is the story is too scattered. Between novels, comics, and audio conversations that have to be unlocked via collectibles, I have a hard time keeping up with what's going on. We need an anchor, a new modern day protagonist..A few of my headcanons are that Aita is the Father of Understanding, Cain was the first activated/awoken Sage, and Adam and Eve's third son, Seth, hunted down Cain..Wow this is really cool! Thanks for sharing this! .Comes with the territory, it seems..ADHD is often co-morbid with other mental health issues such as depression. I myself have ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and have been seeing a psychotherapist for dealing with these issues, as well as a psychiatrist for Adderall and Prozac. I recommend seeing someone if you can, maybe starting with the counselling services at your school. Talking with someone can help disentangle what you're experiencing, help lead you on the right path to getting the help you need, and lets you know you don't have to struggle through this on your own.  .I hated the pacing at the end of Origins. They should've had Bayek going through two interconnected journeys throughout the game. The first would be Bayek's journey of vengence and learning to let go of Khemu, basically what we got in Origins. And the second one should've been Bayek rediscovering or laying the foundations of the Hidden Ones. The big change for the second one from Origins would be it occurred throughout the game, like Altair learning from his targets as he progressed through the story, or Ezio learning from different Assassin teachers in ACII. It should've been a parallel progression that unfolded along side Bayek's vengeance. That would've at least solved some of the pacing problems. .When was freerunning instilled in one's DNA? That was never the case. It's primarily tied to Eagle Vision.\\n\\nAnd how can one access an ideal or Creed in one's DNA if one doesn't have an Animus? How can Bayek tap into this Creed in the middle of the 1st century BCE?.That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.According to the wiki, they're two different people:\\n\\n[Black Flag Employee](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Abstergo_Entertainment_research_analyst)\\n\\n[Rogue Employee](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Helix_research_analyst).Yep, from elementary through middle school, though it was never physical. One coping mechanism I developed was just trying my hardest to be invisible, which included not sharing much about myself. Honestly, if I wasn't bullied I'm not sure if I would be an INFJ. .Thanks. What you did for that kid was incredible, and I'm sure his life is exponentially better because of your efforts. I'm just glad I was able to use my experience to actually help people and point them in the right direction. \\n\\nI'm sorry about the stigma your family has. My parents were very much the same when I started talking about my mental health issues and wanting to see a therapist. They've gotten a lot better, but it hasn't been easy, nor do they fully understand the impact and effects it has on people's lives. It helps that I have a degree in neuroscience, so I do know some things. Keep trying and keep supporting your sister. I hope everything works out well for her. .Yeah, I miss the depth and complexity that the lore had. But it seems fewer and fewer people care about it, and Ubisoft doesn't really care at all..&gt; My historic assassin character can't change events, they're in the past, and I'm just following a predetermined path. Whatever the outcome, it already happened hundreds of years ago.\\n\\nThis was one of the reasons why I had a hard time liking Edward's story in Black Flag, since we already knew what would happen to him and his family down the line. It didn't matter how much his character changed, he was just going to end up dead and his son was going to become a Templar. \\n\\n.Do you have any sources on this? (Genuinely curious).But according to /u/Thunder_54:\\n\\n&gt;As such, all this to say we can logically exclude INFJs from having Fi.\\n\\nDid I just misread or misinterpret something?.Yup, definitely not a fan of the guy; his views were misogynistic and anti-Semitic. He always struck me as being neurotic or having some unresolved issues that bled into his theology. \\n\\nThere is a \"strand\" of Christians that play down or outright reject Paul's teachings, and focus more on what Jesus said and did.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuism.&gt;This is what AC always was to me, I thoroughly enjoy shoot em ups and fighting games but AC has had a fantastic story with, what I believe to be it's real strength, an incite into philosophy and to a certain extent politics.\\n\\nSame :)\\n\\n&gt;Cracking concepts for books, ideologies and movies but unfortunately aren't as impactful in video games\\n\\nWhy not? The BioShock series is, IMO, an excellent example of incorporating philosophy and politics into video games. And I'm sure there are others that do the same..Philosophy: I got into AC late, just before IV:BF came out. I played Brotherhood at a friend's house, which motivated me to buy a PS3 and every AC game that came out. Prior to this I had read several books on Existentialism (still do). While I was playing through the games, I noticed that the Assassins' philosophy was basically Existentialism in a video game. The fact that AC delved into philosophy and the central conflict was an ideological one made me go from \"These are great video games, I like 'em!\" to \"These are like serious works of art. I love these!\" But a lot of those feelings have changed recently.\\n\\nMusic: One of the things that captivated me from when I first played Brotherhood was the music. It wasn't just atmospheric, it was beautiful. I miss Jesper Kyd :(.That's fair. I'm not going to tell you how you should enjoy these games. But I feel that people who play these games simply to play a video game are like people who watch Lord of the Rings movies just for the battle scenes and beautiful settings. You don't have to care about the lore, the history of Middle-earth, or the universe that Tolkien built, but it's there and it's integral to the identity of what he created. And people are are going to discuss, speculate, and nerd out about the lore. Same with AC's lore and gameplay fundamentals. .He completely contradicts the \"create your own Odyssey\" gimmick, I love it!.It's sad because it's true :(.I also won't be getting Odyssey. Maybe I'll get the next game if Ubisoft pulls off a miracle, but I doubt it'll happen..&gt;...just because they didn't have an official creed or brotherhood doesn't make them any less of an assassin.\\n\\nI disagree. In the AC world, an Assassin isn't synonymous with an assassin in real life. An AC Assassin isn't just someone who kills, they're someone who is part of the Brotherhood and a follower of the Creed. Taking these away removes what makes an Assassin different from a hired killer. And it's not enough to just kill in the name of freedom. By that definition, the anti-Ptolemy rebels, and Gamilat and his soldiers all count as Assassins, which seems incorrect..We just need to voice our criticisms with our wallets..Thanks. I put a lot of effort into it because I wanted to make sure that people understood what I'm talking about, and knew that my statements are grounded in lore..What the heck is question 3 asking? \"accident/randomness as your basis for one's mental life\"???.Black Flag is when they started this annoying trend. .&gt;But honestly, i don't know why is it so hard for them to make a good modern day section so that everyone wouldn't complain\\n\\nThis right here is the main problem, because there will always be some subset of the people who dislike decision X, and will be very vocal about it. If you keep MD, you piss off these players. If you phase out MD, you piss off this other group of players. \\n\\nRegarding MD, the two groups arguing over MD are casual players who are looking for fun gameplay or to experience a certain historical time period, and those that are more invested in the lore and themes of the AC universe. The former group disliked Desmond and MD from the get go, and it seems to me they were bolstered by a wave of casual players who started playing AC at IV:BF. This is like watching the LotR from middle of the Two Towers; you miss a lot of important build-up and background info. But that didn't matter because IV:BF was a *fun* game, never mind it butchered MD with the floating tablet, etc. But these players don't care about MD, or Desmond. They just want to sail the high seas and run around historical settings killing people. \\n\\nSo someone at Ubisoft decided they were going to dumb down the story elements to make AC more appealing to the casual player to draw-in more of them, thereby making more $$. The problem with that is AC goes from world-building and story-telling to becoming another annual release game like CoD or Madden. The style and gameplay may change from year to year, but the substance stays the same, and becomes shallow and stale. \\n\\nAs someone who is more invested in the AC universe and lore, what I think they should've done is stuck with the story. You can't appeal to everyone, so you take what criticism is constructive and you stick with your project, adjusting as needed. But to help newer players catch-up, the ones that started at IV:BF, they could've remastered or remade the first game, updating the graphics and controls, and maybe tweaked it to cut down on the repetitiveness. This would've given newer players a chance to catch-up on the story without needing to revert to an older console. \\n\\nBut ultimately we **need** Modern Day. We need something that ties the games together beyond gameplay similarity and style. We need it to create a sense of progression so that we the players feel like we're moving forward with something and that what we do matters. I was ultimately disappointed with how MD in Origins was anti-climatic, but I'm glad we at least have a new MD protagonist with a *name* and a *face*. Baby steps in the right direction. I hope in the next game Ubi figures out two things: \\n\\n1. MD story direction. Who are we the players, as Layla Hassan, fighting against? Is it the Templars? The Instruments of the First Will? Some other unknown threat? Whatever they decide, they need to pick someone and stick with it. They shouldn't introduce something new if they aren't going to finish the story line in the games. \\n\\n2. Use Layla's newbie status to give us a crash course. Because Layla is fairly new in the Assassin-Templar conflict, it would make sense that there is a lot she doesn't know and needed to be filled in on. I would love to see Layla work with William, Shaun, and Rebecca to learn about some AC lore and what happened in previous games, learn about the current status of the Assassin-Templar war, and go through some Assassin training. This would fill-in newer players with some major plot points, establish what the current MD goal is, and give Layla, and by extension us the players, a greater role in shaping how the story unfolds. Heck, if they could pull it off, I think it would be neat if Layla became the torch-bearer for Desmond's legacy. .I'm glad I was able to give some hope, even a little bit. I know how difficult and hopeless it can feel. And I wouldn't worry too much about the time frame. Everyone is different, and so the best treatment for each person is going to be a little bit different. It could take you a much shorter time period..And what does an earlier, unrefined version of the Creed look like?.&gt;  Whether you find purpose in making a better world for your kids, your friends kids, yourself or even other species: doesn't matter.\\n\\nThis is definitely where I find my purpose. To try to make the world a better place. \\n\\nI don't know if you know this already, but if you find this interesting, I'd recommend looking into existentialism. It's where I find a lot my inspiration..Cool, thanks for being civil and understanding.&gt;Just because INFJs tend to be incredibly empathetic and take others' emotions on as their own shouldn't mean they're therefore incapable of knowing what their own emotions are. I, personally, am extremely in touch with my own emotions. I just usually have a hard time knowing what to DO with them. \\n\\nRight, I thought that just because you have a better grasp on how you feel about something didn't mean that you all of a sudden put your feelings as a priority above everyone else's, nor that you suddenly lost your ability to empathize with people. \\n\\nP.S. You should keep your comment as is. It's perfectly fine the way it is. :).I was just gonna post this!\\n\\nEdit: Another fun fact: She's dead! :D.A historical FPS! /s  \n",

       "4  My heart goes out to you, take my energy and anything else you need.  Don't forget to count your blessings, and take responsibility for your achievements as well.  I felt alone when I was in my rut but I wasn't!  In spirit, I like *downloaded* people's personality and projected their souls in my mind. \"What would my best friend say to me right now? Oh, yah she'll say this...\". I could predict what they say to me as the person they are.  Project the people in your life who literally want the best for you and the best of you.  You can take this with anything, good or bad, small or big. I took this introspection, then seeked help to extend my support system and took action to improve myself.\\n\\nhere's some proof of this in action!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6bgSITBrVQ\\n\\nSorry for the tardiness, I wanted to respond this as fruitfully as possible so I set aside some energy aside to think about it. Hope this helps!\\n.The Life of Pi\\n\\nPlot:

But it would be really cool to see this come to life..Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Godfather by Mario Puzo, 1984 by George Orwell, and The Death of Ivan Ilyich by Leo Tolstoy. .I think with Syndicate's system, we could easily have a game where you could play as both Connor and Arno, Connor being the more combat oriented one, and Arno focusing more on stealth..&amp;gt;Also, there are people like myself who are disappointed in the overall handling of the overarching story as of this moment.\\n\\nSame. Part of it for me is the story is too scattered. Between novels, comics, and audio conversations that have to be unlocked via collectibles, I have a hard time keeping up with what's going on. We need an anchor, a new modern day protagonist..A few of my headcanons are that Aita is the Father of Understanding, Cain was the first activated/awoken Sage, and Adam and Eve's third son, Seth, hunted down Cain..Wow this is really cool! Thanks for sharing this! .Comes with the territory, it seems..ADHD is often co-morbid with other mental health issues such as depression. I myself have ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and have been seeing a psychotherapist for dealing with these issues, as well as a psychiatrist for Adderall and Prozac. I recommend seeing someone if you can, maybe starting with the counselling services at your school. Talking with someone can help disentangle what you're experiencing, help lead you on the right path to getting the help you need, and lets you know you don't have to struggle through this on your own.  .I hated the pacing at the end of Origins. They should've had Bayek going through two interconnected journeys throughout the game. The first would be Bayek's journey of vengence and learning to let go of Khemu, basically what we got in Origins. And the second one should've been Bayek rediscovering or laying the foundations of the Hidden Ones. The big change for the second one from Origins would be it occurred throughout the game, like Altair learning from his targets as he progressed through the story, or Ezio learning from different Assassin teachers in ACII. It should've been a parallel progression that unfolded along side Bayek's vengeance. That would've at least solved some of the pacing problems. .When was freerunning instilled in one's DNA? That was never the case. It's primarily tied to Eagle Vision.\\n\\nAnd how can one access an ideal or Creed in one's DNA if one doesn't have an Animus? How can Bayek tap into this Creed in the middle of the 1st century BCE?.That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.According to the wiki, they're two different people:\\n\\n[Black Flag Employee](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Abstergo_Entertainment_research_analyst)\\n\\n[Rogue Employee](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Helix_research_analyst).Yep, from elementary through middle school, though it was never physical. One coping mechanism I developed was just trying my hardest to be invisible, which included not sharing much about myself. Honestly, if I wasn't bullied I'm not sure if I would be an INFJ. .Thanks. What you did for that kid was incredible, and I'm sure his life is exponentially better because of your efforts. I'm just glad I was able to use my experience to actually help people and point them in the right direction. \\n\\nI'm sorry about the stigma your family has. My parents were very much the same when I started talking about my mental health issues and wanting to see a therapist. They've gotten a lot better, but it hasn't been easy, nor do they fully understand the impact and effects it has on people's lives. It helps that I have a degree in neuroscience, so I do know some things. Keep trying and keep supporting your sister. I hope everything works out well for her. .Yeah, I miss the depth and complexity that the lore had. But it seems fewer and fewer people care about it, and Ubisoft doesn't really care at all..&amp;gt; My historic assassin character can't change events, they're in the past, and I'm just following a predetermined path. Whatever the outcome, it already happened hundreds of years ago.\\n\\nThis was one of the reasons why I had a hard time liking Edward's story in Black Flag, since we already knew what would happen to him and his family down the line. It didn't matter how much his character changed, he was just going to end up dead and his son was going to become a Templar. \\n\\n.Do you have any sources on this? (Genuinely curious).But according to /u/Thunder_54:\\n\\n&amp;gt;As such, all this to say we can logically exclude INFJs from having Fi.\\n\\nDid I just misread or misinterpret something?.Yup, definitely not a fan of the guy; his views were misogynistic and anti-Semitic. He always struck me as being neurotic or having some unresolved issues that bled into his theology. \\n\\nThere is a \"strand\" of Christians that play down or outright reject Paul's teachings, and focus more on what Jesus said and did.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuism.&amp;gt;This is what AC always was to me, I thoroughly enjoy shoot em ups and fighting games but AC has had a fantastic story with, what I believe to be it's real strength, an incite into philosophy and to a certain extent politics.\\n\\nSame :)\\n\\n&amp;gt;Cracking concepts for books, ideologies and movies but unfortunately aren't as impactful in video games\\n\\nWhy not? The BioShock series is, IMO, an excellent example of incorporating philosophy and politics into video games. And I'm sure there are others that do the same..Philosophy: I got into AC late, just before IV:BF came out. I played Brotherhood at a friend's house, which motivated me to buy a PS3 and every AC game that came out. Prior to this I had read several books on Existentialism (still do). While I was playing through the games, I noticed that the Assassins' philosophy was basically Existentialism in a video game. The fact that AC delved into philosophy and the central conflict was an ideological one made me go from \"These are great video games, I like 'em!\" to \"These are like serious works of art. I love these!\" But a lot of those feelings have changed recently.\\n\\nMusic: One of the things that captivated me from when I first played Brotherhood was the music. It wasn't just atmospheric, it was beautiful. I miss Jesper Kyd :(.That's fair. I'm not going to tell you how you should enjoy these games. But I feel that people who play these games simply to play a video game are like people who watch Lord of the Rings movies just for the battle scenes and beautiful settings. You don't have to care about the lore, the history of Middle-earth, or the universe that Tolkien built, but it's there and it's integral to the identity of what he created. And people are are going to discuss, speculate, and nerd out about the lore. Same with AC's lore and gameplay fundamentals. .He completely contradicts the \"create your own Odyssey\" gimmick, I love it!.It's sad because it's true :(.I also won't be getting Odyssey. Maybe I'll get the next game if Ubisoft pulls off a miracle, but I doubt it'll happen..&amp;gt;...just because they didn't have an official creed or brotherhood doesn't make them any less of an assassin.\\n\\nI disagree. In the AC world, an Assassin isn't synonymous with an assassin in real life. An AC Assassin isn't just someone who kills, they're someone who is part of the Brotherhood and a follower of the Creed. Taking these away removes what makes an Assassin different from a hired killer. And it's not enough to just kill in the name of freedom. By that definition, the anti-Ptolemy rebels, and Gamilat and his soldiers all count as Assassins, which seems incorrect..We just need to voice our criticisms with our wallets..Thanks. I put a lot of effort into it because I wanted to make sure that people understood what I'm talking about, and knew that my statements are grounded in lore..What the heck is question 3 asking? \"accident/randomness as your basis for one's mental life\"???.Black Flag is when they started this annoying trend. .&amp;gt;But honestly, i don't know why is it so hard for them to make a good modern day section so that everyone wouldn't complain\\n\\nThis right here is the main problem, because there will always be some subset of the people who dislike decision X, and will be very vocal about it. If you keep MD, you piss off these players. If you phase out MD, you piss off this other group of players. \\n\\nRegarding MD, the two groups arguing over MD are casual players who are looking for fun gameplay or to experience a certain historical time period, and those that are more invested in the lore and themes of the AC universe. The former group disliked Desmond and MD from the get go, and it seems to me they were bolstered by a wave of casual players who started playing AC at IV:BF. This is like watching the LotR from middle of the Two Towers; you miss a lot of important build-up and background info. But that didn't matter because IV:BF was a *fun* game, never mind it butchered MD with the floating tablet, etc. But these players don't care about MD, or Desmond. They just want to sail the high seas and run around historical settings killing people. \\n\\nSo someone at Ubisoft decided they were going to dumb down the story elements to make AC more appealing to the casual player to draw-in more of them, thereby making more $$. The problem with that is AC goes from world-building and story-telling to becoming another annual release game like CoD or Madden. The style and gameplay may change from year to year, but the substance stays the same, and becomes shallow and stale. \\n\\nAs someone who is more invested in the AC universe and lore, what I think they should've done is stuck with the story. You can't appeal to everyone, so you take what criticism is constructive and you stick with your project, adjusting as needed. But to help newer players catch-up, the ones that started at IV:BF, they could've remastered or remade the first game, updating the graphics and controls, and maybe tweaked it to cut down on the repetitiveness. This would've given newer players a chance to catch-up on the story without needing to revert to an older console. \\n\\nBut ultimately we **need** Modern Day. We need something that ties the games together beyond gameplay similarity and style. We need it to create a sense of progression so that we the players feel like we're moving forward with something and that what we do matters. I was ultimately disappointed with how MD in Origins was anti-climatic, but I'm glad we at least have a new MD protagonist with a *name* and a *face*. Baby steps in the right direction. I hope in the next game Ubi figures out two things: \\n\\n1. MD story direction. Who are we the players, as Layla Hassan, fighting against? Is it the Templars? The Instruments of the First Will? Some other unknown threat? Whatever they decide, they need to pick someone and stick with it. They shouldn't introduce something new if they aren't going to finish the story line in the games. \\n\\n2. Use Layla's newbie status to give us a crash course. Because Layla is fairly new in the Assassin-Templar conflict, it would make sense that there is a lot she doesn't know and needed to be filled in on. I would love to see Layla work with William, Shaun, and Rebecca to learn about some AC lore and what happened in previous games, learn about the current status of the Assassin-Templar war, and go through some Assassin training. This would fill-in newer players with some major plot points, establish what the current MD goal is, and give Layla, and by extension us the players, a greater role in shaping how the story unfolds. Heck, if they could pull it off, I think it would be neat if Layla became the torch-bearer for Desmond's legacy. .I'm glad I was able to give some hope, even a little bit. I know how difficult and hopeless it can feel. And I wouldn't worry too much about the time frame. Everyone is different, and so the best treatment for each person is going to be a little bit different. It could take you a much shorter time period..And what does an earlier, unrefined version of the Creed look like?.&amp;gt;  Whether you find purpose in making a better world for your kids, your friends kids, yourself or even other species: doesn't matter.\\n\\nThis is definitely where I find my purpose. To try to make the world a better place. \\n\\nI don't know if you know this already, but if you find this interesting, I'd recommend looking into existentialism. It's where I find a lot my inspiration..Cool, thanks for being civil and understanding.&amp;gt;Just because INFJs tend to be incredibly empathetic and take others' emotions on as their own shouldn't mean they're therefore incapable of knowing what their own emotions are. I, personally, am extremely in touch with my own emotions. I just usually have a hard time knowing what to DO with them. \\n\\nRight, I thought that just because you have a better grasp on how you feel about something didn't mean that you all of a sudden put your feelings as a priority above everyone else's, nor that you suddenly lost your ability to empathize with people. \\n\\nP.S. You should keep your comment as is. It's perfectly fine the way it is. :).I was just gonna post this!\\n\\nEdit: Another fun fact: She's dead! :D.A historical FPS! /s</td>\n",

       "1  You'd think it would be that easy... And it would be if people would outright purchase cars in cash.  Instead we get loans or lease so you have all these requirements the customer needs to meet in order to follow the law and agreement between the consumer and the bank.\\n\\nThe dealership runs OFAC, red flags (fraud alert for those trying to purchase a car with stolen identity), and makes sure you have full coverage insurance to get an auto loan (in my state anyway).  Then there's state paperwork like title transfer, etc.  \\n\\nSource:  I work at a dealership.  .Red Grape Wine Mad Dog 20/20 &amp; Pepsi \\n\\nGreen Apple Pucker &amp; Sprite .Getting mine hurt like a motherfucker AND it didn't work AND I got an episiotomy.  \\n\\nNeedless to say, I have only one kid..This is why I don't have health insurance - just dental.  That's $10220/year out-of-pocket.  You're better off paying cash..Diet Dr. Pepper alllll day. .&gt;And so Luke does the only thing he can do. He leaves. Which, by the way, is exactly what Yoda did at the end of the prequels. \\n\\nObi Wan and Yoda were in hiding because of Order 66. You know when the Clone Army was ordered to suddenly turn on and eliminate their unsuspecting Jedi allies? The Jedi Counsel was working with the Republic against the Separatists and all of the sudden it was the Republic and the Separatists against the Jedi. Luke was training some Padawans and I'm going to go ahead and assume this was a time of peace before the First Order came into significant power.  Not the same situation.\\n\\n&gt;I understand why he would come to the conclusion that the Jedi must end.\\n\\nForce-sensitivity isn't just going to go away because the Jedi no longer train each other.  It's not a weapon of mass destruction, it's a gift one is born with that the Jedi recognize must be harnessed and controlled.  It would be irresponsible not to..You and the community will always have my support, brother. ��.I see tattoos that I would love to have on me but I know better than to ask my artist to give me an exact copy.  It's insulting to his talent, the person that designed the original, and the person that got the original. \\n\\nI give him examples of what I want and tell him what I like about the design.  He then comes back with something just as awesome but obviously different.  \\n\\nIt's also kind of known that a good artist won't copy a design, they'll at least change it a bit..He does this in Girls very well..Episodes IV-VI maybe are about empathy and apathy?\\n\\nEpisodes VII-IX seem to be about selflessness and selfishness?.Or at least ANY established character..There is talk that the big 3 will be ending leasing in the next few years because they are losing money in the long-run.  \\n\\nAt the end of your lease the leasing company gets your turn-in because they technically own it, unless you want to buy it.  They then sell the vehicle - usually at auction to other dealerships as a used car.  \\n\\nAs for accidents, if your vehicle is totaled, GAP insurance covers the remainder of the loan and that coverage is built into your contract.  Leasing companies require full coverage so any accidents must be repaired prior to turn-in or you are charged.\\n\\nSource:  I work at a dealership.

       "2  Meiji Era Japan. Remnants of feudal Japan meet the industrial West. http://imgur.com/gallery/hEjpl\\n\\nEdit: This is unofficial concept art. But it would be really cool to see this come to life..Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Godfather by Mario Puzo, 1984 by George Orwell, and The Death of Ivan Ilyich by Leo Tolstoy. .I think with Syndicate's system, we could easily have a game where you could play as both Connor and Arno, Connor being the more combat oriented one, and Arno focusing more on stealth..&gt;Also, there are people like myself who are disappointed in the overall handling of the overarching story as of this moment.\\n\\nSame. Part of it for me is the story is too scattered. Between novels, comics, and audio conversations that have to be unlocked via collectibles, I have a hard time keeping up with what's going on. We need an anchor, a new modern day protagonist..A few of my headcanons are that Aita is the Father of Understanding, Cain was the first activated/awoken Sage, and Adam and Eve's third son, Seth, hunted down Cain..Wow this is really cool! Thanks for sharing this! .Comes with the territory, it seems..ADHD is often co-morbid with other mental health issues such as depression. I myself have ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and have been seeing a psychotherapist for dealing with these issues, as well as a psychiatrist for Adderall and Prozac. I recommend seeing someone if you can, maybe starting with the counselling services at your school. Talking with someone can help disentangle what you're experiencing, help lead you on the right path to getting the help you need, and lets you know you don't have to struggle through this on your own.  .I hated the pacing at the end of Origins. They should've had Bayek going through two interconnected journeys throughout the game. The first would be Bayek's journey of vengence and learning to let go of Khemu, basically what we got in Origins. And the second one should've been Bayek rediscovering or laying the foundations of the Hidden Ones. The big change for the second one from Origins would be it occurred throughout the game, like Altair learning from his targets as he progressed through the story, or Ezio learning from different Assassin teachers in ACII. It should've been a parallel progression that unfolded along side Bayek's vengeance. That would've at least solved some of the pacing problems. .When was freerunning instilled in one's DNA? That was never the case. It's primarily tied to Eagle Vision.\\n\\nAnd how can one access an ideal or Creed in one's DNA if one doesn't have an Animus? How can Bayek tap into this Creed in the middle of the 1st century BCE?.That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.According to the wiki, they're two different people:\\n\\n[Black Flag Employee](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Abstergo_Entertainment_research_analyst)\\n\\n[Rogue Employee](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Helix_research_analyst).Yep, from elementary through middle school, though it was never physical. One coping mechanism I developed was just trying my hardest to be invisible, which included not sharing much about myself. Honestly, if I wasn't bullied I'm not sure if I would be an INFJ. .Thanks. What you did for that kid was incredible, and I'm sure his life is exponentially better because of your efforts. I'm just glad I was able to use my experience to actually help people and point them in the right direction. \\n\\nI'm sorry about the stigma your family has. My parents were very much the same when I started talking about my mental health issues and wanting to see a therapist. They've gotten a lot better, but it hasn't been easy, nor do they fully understand the impact and effects it has on people's lives. It helps that I have a degree in neuroscience, so I do know some things. Keep trying and keep supporting your sister. I hope everything works out well for her. .Yeah, I miss the depth and complexity that the lore had. But it seems fewer and fewer people care about it, and Ubisoft doesn't really care at all..&gt; My historic assassin character can't change events, they're in the past, and I'm just following a predetermined path. Whatever the outcome, it already happened hundreds of years ago.\\n\\nThis was one of the reasons why I had a hard time liking Edward's story in Black Flag, since we already knew what would happen to him and his family down the line. It didn't matter how much his character changed, he was just going to end up dead and his son was going to become a Templar. \\n\\n.Do you have any sources on this? (Genuinely curious).But according to /u/Thunder_54:\\n\\n&gt;As such, all this to say we can logically exclude INFJs from having Fi.\\n\\nDid I just misread or misinterpret something?.Yup, definitely not a fan of the guy; his views were misogynistic and anti-Semitic. He always struck me as being neurotic or having some unresolved issues that bled into his theology. \\n\\nThere is a \"strand\" of Christians that play down or outright reject Paul's teachings, and focus more on what Jesus said and did.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuism.&gt;This is what AC always was to me, I thoroughly enjoy shoot em ups and fighting games but AC has had a fantastic story with, what I believe to be it's real strength, an incite into philosophy and to a certain extent politics.\\n\\nSame :)\\n\\n&gt;Cracking concepts for books, ideologies and movies but unfortunately aren't as impactful in video games\\n\\nWhy not? The BioShock series is, IMO, an excellent example of incorporating philosophy and politics into video games. And I'm sure there are others that do the same..Philosophy: I got into AC late, just before IV:BF came out. I played Brotherhood at a friend's house, which motivated me to buy a PS3 and every AC game that came out. Prior to this I had read several books on Existentialism (still do). While I was playing through the games, I noticed that the Assassins' philosophy was basically Existentialism in a video game. The fact that AC delved into philosophy and the central conflict was an ideological one made me go from \"These are great video games, I like 'em!\" to \"These are like serious works of art. I love these!\" But a lot of those feelings have changed recently.\\n\\nMusic: One of the things that captivated me from when I first played Brotherhood was the music. It wasn't just atmospheric, it was beautiful. I miss Jesper Kyd :(.That's fair. I'm not going to tell you how you should enjoy these games. But I feel that people who play these games simply to play a video game are like people who watch Lord of the Rings movies just for the battle scenes and beautiful settings. You don't have to care about the lore, the history of Middle-earth, or the universe that Tolkien built, but it's there and it's integral to the identity of what he created. And people are are going to discuss, speculate, and nerd out about the lore. Same with AC's lore and gameplay fundamentals. .He completely contradicts the \"create your own Odyssey\" gimmick, I love it!.It's sad because it's true :(.I also won't be getting Odyssey. Maybe I'll get the next game if Ubisoft pulls off a miracle, but I doubt it'll happen..&gt;...just because they didn't have an official creed or brotherhood doesn't make them any less of an assassin.\\n\\nI disagree. In the AC world, an Assassin isn't synonymous with an assassin in real life. An AC Assassin isn't just someone who kills, they're someone who is part of the Brotherhood and a follower of the Creed. Taking these away removes what makes an Assassin different from a hired killer. And it's not enough to just kill in the name of freedom. By that definition, the anti-Ptolemy rebels, and Gamilat and his soldiers all count as Assassins, which seems incorrect..We just need to voice our criticisms with our wallets..Thanks. I put a lot of effort into it because I wanted to make sure that people understood what I'm talking about, and knew that my statements are grounded in lore..What the heck is question 3 asking? \"accident/randomness as your basis for one's mental life\"???.Black Flag is when they started this annoying trend. .&gt;But honestly, i don't know why is it so hard for them to make a good modern day section so that everyone wouldn't complain\\n\\nThis right here is the main problem, because there will always be some subset of the people who dislike decision X, and will be very vocal about it. If you keep MD, you piss off these players. If you phase out MD, you piss off this other group of players. \\n\\nRegarding MD, the two groups arguing over MD are casual players who are looking for fun gameplay or to experience a certain historical time period, and those that are more invested in the lore and themes of the AC universe. The former group disliked Desmond and MD from the get go, and it seems to me they were bolstered by a wave of casual players who started playing AC at IV:BF. This is like watching the LotR from middle of the Two Towers; you miss a lot of important build-up and background info. But that didn't matter because IV:BF was a *fun* game, never mind it butchered MD with the floating tablet, etc. But these players don't care about MD, or Desmond. They just want to sail the high seas and run around historical settings killing people. \\n\\nSo someone at Ubisoft decided they were going to dumb down the story elements to make AC more appealing to the casual player to draw-in more of them, thereby making more $$. The problem with that is AC goes from world-building and story-telling to becoming another annual release game like CoD or Madden. The style and gameplay may change from year to year, but the substance stays the same, and becomes shallow and stale. \\n\\nAs someone who is more invested in the AC universe and lore, what I think they should've done is stuck with the story. You can't appeal to everyone, so you take what criticism is constructive and you stick with your project, adjusting as needed. But to help newer players catch-up, the ones that started at IV:BF, they could've remastered or remade the first game, updating the graphics and controls, and maybe tweaked it to cut down on the repetitiveness. This would've given newer players a chance to catch-up on the story without needing to revert to an older console. \\n\\nBut ultimately we **need** Modern Day. We need something that ties the games together beyond gameplay similarity and style. We need it to create a sense of progression so that we the players feel like we're moving forward with something and that what we do matters. I was ultimately disappointed with how MD in Origins was anti-climatic, but I'm glad we at least have a new MD protagonist with a *name* and a *face*. Baby steps in the right direction. I hope in the next game Ubi figures out two things: \\n\\n1. MD story direction. Who are we the players, as Layla Hassan, fighting against? Is it the Templars? The Instruments of the First Will? Some other unknown threat? Whatever they decide, they need to pick someone and stick with it. They shouldn't introduce something new if they aren't going to finish the story line in the games. \\n\\n2. Use Layla's newbie status to give us a crash course. Because Layla is fairly new in the Assassin-Templar conflict, it would make sense that there is a lot she doesn't know and needed to be filled in on. I would love to see Layla work with William, Shaun, and Rebecca to learn about some AC lore and what happened in previous games, learn about the current status of the Assassin-Templar war, and go through some Assassin training. This would fill-in newer players with some major plot points, establish what the current MD goal is, and give Layla, and by extension us the players, a greater role in shaping how the story unfolds. Heck, if they could pull it off, I think it would be neat if Layla became the torch-bearer for Desmond's legacy. .I'm glad I was able to give some hope, even a little bit. I know how difficult and hopeless it can feel. And I wouldn't worry too much about the time frame. Everyone is different, and so the best treatment for each person is going to be a little bit different. It could take you a much shorter time period..And what does an earlier, unrefined version of the Creed look like?.&gt;  Whether you find purpose in making a better world for your kids, your friends kids, yourself or even other species: doesn't matter.\\n\\nThis is definitely where I find my purpose. To try to make the world a better place. \\n\\nI don't know if you know this already, but if you find this interesting, I'd recommend looking into existentialism. It's where I find a lot my inspiration..Cool, thanks for being civil and understanding.&gt;Just because INFJs tend to be incredibly empathetic and take others' emotions on as their own shouldn't mean they're therefore incapable of knowing what their own emotions are. I, personally, am extremely in touch with my own emotions. I just usually have a hard time knowing what to DO with them. \\n\\nRight, I thought that just because you have a better grasp on how you feel about something didn't mean that you all of a sudden put your feelings as a priority above everyone else's, nor that you suddenly lost your ability to empathize with people. \\n\\nP.S. You should keep your comment as is. It's perfectly fine the way it is. :).I was just gonna post this!\\n\\nEdit: Another fun fact: She's dead! :D.A historical FPS! /s  \n",

       "4  My heart goes out to you, take my energy and anything else you need.  Don't forget to count your blessings, and take responsibility for your achievements as well.  I felt alone when I was in my rut but I wasn't!  In spirit, I like *downloaded* people's personality and projected their souls in my mind. \"What would my best friend say to me right now? Oh, yah she'll say this...\". I could predict what they say to me as the person they are.  Project the people in your life who literally want the best for you and the best of you.  You can take this with anything, good or bad, small or big. I took this introspection, then seeked help to extend my support system and took action to improve myself.\\n\\nhere's some proof of this in action!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6bgSITBrVQ\\n\\nSorry for the tardiness, I wanted to respond this as fruitfully as possible so I set aside some energy aside to think about it.
