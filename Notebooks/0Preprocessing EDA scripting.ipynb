But it would be really cool to see this come to life..Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Godfather by Mario Puzo, 1984 by George Orwell, and The Death of Ivan Ilyich by Leo Tolstoy. .I think with Syndicate's system, we could easily have a game where you could play as both Connor and Arno, Connor being the more combat oriented one, and Arno focusing more on stealth..&amp;gt;Also, there are people like myself who are disappointed in the overall handling of the overarching story as of this moment.\\n\\nSame. Part of it for me is the story is too scattered. Between novels, comics, and audio conversations that have to be unlocked via collectibles, I have a hard time keeping up with what's going on. We need an anchor, a new modern day protagonist..A few of my headcanons are that Aita is the Father of Understanding, Cain was the first activated/awoken Sage, and Adam and Eve's third son, Seth, hunted down Cain..Wow this is really cool! Thanks for sharing this! .Comes with the territory, it seems..ADHD is often co-morbid with other mental health issues such as depression. I myself have ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and have been seeing a psychotherapist for dealing with these issues, as well as a psychiatrist for Adderall and Prozac. I recommend seeing someone if you can, maybe starting with the counselling services at your school. Talking with someone can help disentangle what you're experiencing, help lead you on the right path to getting the help you need, and lets you know you don't have to struggle through this on your own.  .I hated the pacing at the end of Origins. They should've had Bayek going through two interconnected journeys throughout the game. The first would be Bayek's journey of vengence and learning to let go of Khemu, basically what we got in Origins. And the second one should've been Bayek rediscovering or laying the foundations of the Hidden Ones. The big change for the second one from Origins would be it occurred throughout the game, like Altair learning from his targets as he progressed through the story, or Ezio learning from different Assassin teachers in ACII. It should've been a parallel progression that unfolded along side Bayek's vengeance. That would've at least solved some of the pacing problems. .When was freerunning instilled in one's DNA? That was never the case. It's primarily tied to Eagle Vision.\\n\\nAnd how can one access an ideal or Creed in one's DNA if one doesn't have an Animus? How can Bayek tap into this Creed in the middle of the 1st century BCE?.That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.According to the wiki, they're two different people:\\n\\n[Black Flag Employee](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Abstergo_Entertainment_research_analyst)\\n\\n[Rogue Employee](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Helix_research_analyst).Yep, from elementary through middle school, though it was never physical. One coping mechanism I developed was just trying my hardest to be invisible, which included not sharing much about myself. Honestly, if I wasn't bullied I'm not sure if I would be an INFJ. .Thanks. What you did for that kid was incredible, and I'm sure his life is exponentially better because of your efforts. I'm just glad I was able to use my experience to actually help people and point them in the right direction. \\n\\nI'm sorry about the stigma your family has. My parents were very much the same when I started talking about my mental health issues and wanting to see a therapist. They've gotten a lot better, but it hasn't been easy, nor do they fully understand the impact and effects it has on people's lives. It helps that I have a degree in neuroscience, so I do know some things. Keep trying and keep supporting your sister. I hope everything works out well for her. .Yeah, I miss the depth and complexity that the lore had. But it seems fewer and fewer people care about it, and Ubisoft doesn't really care at all..&amp;gt; My historic assassin character can't change events, they're in the past, and I'm just following a predetermined path. Whatever the outcome, it already happened hundreds of years ago.\\n\\nThis was one of the reasons why I had a hard time liking Edward's story in Black Flag, since we already knew what would happen to him and his family down the line. It didn't matter how much his character changed, he was just going to end up dead and his son was going to become a Templar. \\n\\n.Do you have any sources on this? (Genuinely curious).But according to /u/Thunder_54:\\n\\n&amp;gt;As such, all this to say we can logically exclude INFJs from having Fi.\\n\\nDid I just misread or misinterpret something?.Yup, definitely not a fan of the guy; his views were misogynistic and anti-Semitic. He always struck me as being neurotic or having some unresolved issues that bled into his theology. \\n\\nThere is a \"strand\" of Christians that play down or outright reject Paul's teachings, and focus more on what Jesus said and did.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuism.&amp;gt;This is what AC always was to me, I thoroughly enjoy shoot em ups and fighting games but AC has had a fantastic story with, what I believe to be it's real strength, an incite into philosophy and to a certain extent politics.\\n\\nSame :)\\n\\n&amp;gt;Cracking concepts for books, ideologies and movies but unfortunately aren't as impactful in video games\\n\\nWhy not? The BioShock series is, IMO, an excellent example of incorporating philosophy and politics into video games. And I'm sure there are others that do the same..Philosophy: I got into AC late, just before IV:BF came out. I played Brotherhood at a friend's house, which motivated me to buy a PS3 and every AC game that came out. Prior to this I had read several books on Existentialism (still do). While I was playing through the games, I noticed that the Assassins' philosophy was basically Existentialism in a video game. The fact that AC delved into philosophy and the central conflict was an ideological one made me go from \"These are great video games, I like 'em!\" to \"These are like serious works of art. I love these!\" But a lot of those feelings have changed recently.\\n\\nMusic: One of the things that captivated me from when I first played Brotherhood was the music. It wasn't just atmospheric, it was beautiful. I miss Jesper Kyd :(.That's fair. I'm not going to tell you how you should enjoy these games. But I feel that people who play these games simply to play a video game are like people who watch Lord of the Rings movies just for the battle scenes and beautiful settings. You don't have to care about the lore, the history of Middle-earth, or the universe that Tolkien built, but it's there and it's integral to the identity of what he created. And people are are going to discuss, speculate, and nerd out about the lore. Same with AC's lore and gameplay fundamentals. .He completely contradicts the \"create your own Odyssey\" gimmick, I love it!.It's sad because it's true :(.I also won't be getting Odyssey. Maybe I'll get the next game if Ubisoft pulls off a miracle, but I doubt it'll happen..&amp;gt;...just because they didn't have an official creed or brotherhood doesn't make them any less of an assassin.\\n\\nI disagree. In the AC world, an Assassin isn't synonymous with an assassin in real life. An AC Assassin isn't just someone who kills, they're someone who is part of the Brotherhood and a follower of the Creed. Taking these away removes what makes an Assassin different from a hired killer. And it's not enough to just kill in the name of freedom. By that definition, the anti-Ptolemy rebels, and Gamilat and his soldiers all count as Assassins, which seems incorrect..We just need to voice our criticisms with our wallets..Thanks. I put a lot of effort into it because I wanted to make sure that people understood what I'm talking about, and knew that my statements are grounded in lore..What the heck is question 3 asking? \"accident/randomness as your basis for one's mental life\"???.Black Flag is when they started this annoying trend. .&amp;gt;But honestly, i don't know why is it so hard for them to make a good modern day section so that everyone wouldn't complain\\n\\nThis right here is the main problem, because there will always be some subset of the people who dislike decision X, and will be very vocal about it. If you keep MD, you piss off these players. If you phase out MD, you piss off this other group of players. \\n\\nRegarding MD, the two groups arguing over MD are casual players who are looking for fun gameplay or to experience a certain historical time period, and those that are more invested in the lore and themes of the AC universe. The former group disliked Desmond and MD from the get go, and it seems to me they were bolstered by a wave of casual players who started playing AC at IV:BF. This is like watching the LotR from middle of the Two Towers; you miss a lot of important build-up and background info. But that didn't matter because IV:BF was a *fun* game, never mind it butchered MD with the floating tablet, etc. But these players don't care about MD, or Desmond. They just want to sail the high seas and run around historical settings killing people. \\n\\nSo someone at Ubisoft decided they were going to dumb down the story elements to make AC more appealing to the casual player to draw-in more of them, thereby making more $$. The problem with that is AC goes from world-building and story-telling to becoming another annual release game like CoD or Madden. The style and gameplay may change from year to year, but the substance stays the same, and becomes shallow and stale. \\n\\nAs someone who is more invested in the AC universe and lore, what I think they should've done is stuck with the story. You can't appeal to everyone, so you take what criticism is constructive and you stick with your project, adjusting as needed. But to help newer players catch-up, the ones that started at IV:BF, they could've remastered or remade the first game, updating the graphics and controls, and maybe tweaked it to cut down on the repetitiveness. This would've given newer players a chance to catch-up on the story without needing to revert to an older console. \\n\\nBut ultimately we **need** Modern Day. We need something that ties the games together beyond gameplay similarity and style. We need it to create a sense of progression so that we the players feel like we're moving forward with something and that what we do matters. I was ultimately disappointed with how MD in Origins was anti-climatic, but I'm glad we at least have a new MD protagonist with a *name* and a *face*. Baby steps in the right direction. I hope in the next game Ubi figures out two things: \\n\\n1. MD story direction. Who are we the players, as Layla Hassan, fighting against? Is it the Templars? The Instruments of the First Will? Some other unknown threat? Whatever they decide, they need to pick someone and stick with it. They shouldn't introduce something new if they aren't going to finish the story line in the games. \\n\\n2. Use Layla's newbie status to give us a crash course. Because Layla is fairly new in the Assassin-Templar conflict, it would make sense that there is a lot she doesn't know and needed to be filled in on. I would love to see Layla work with William, Shaun, and Rebecca to learn about some AC lore and what happened in previous games, learn about the current status of the Assassin-Templar war, and go through some Assassin training. This would fill-in newer players with some major plot points, establish what the current MD goal is, and give Layla, and by extension us the players, a greater role in shaping how the story unfolds. Heck, if they could pull it off, I think it would be neat if Layla became the torch-bearer for Desmond's legacy. .I'm glad I was able to give some hope, even a little bit. I know how difficult and hopeless it can feel. And I wouldn't worry too much about the time frame. Everyone is different, and so the best treatment for each person is going to be a little bit different. It could take you a much shorter time period..And what does an earlier, unrefined version of the Creed look like?.&amp;gt;  Whether you find purpose in making a better world for your kids, your friends kids, yourself or even other species: doesn't matter.\\n\\nThis is definitely where I find my purpose. To try to make the world a better place. \\n\\nI don't know if you know this already, but if you find this interesting, I'd recommend looking into existentialism. It's where I find a lot my inspiration..Cool, thanks for being civil and understanding.&amp;gt;Just because INFJs tend to be incredibly empathetic and take others' emotions on as their own shouldn't mean they're therefore incapable of knowing what their own emotions are. I, personally, am extremely in touch with my own emotions. I just usually have a hard time knowing what to DO with them. \\n\\nRight, I thought that just because you have a better grasp on how you feel about something didn't mean that you all of a sudden put your feelings as a priority above everyone else's, nor that you suddenly lost your ability to empathize with people. \\n\\nP.S. You should keep your comment as is. It's perfectly fine the way it is. :).I was just gonna post this!\\n\\nEdit: Another fun fact: She's dead! :D.A historical FPS! /s</td>\n",

All white wouldn't suit me and I'd be worried about spilling something on it..Congratulations!.I like the red with the gum sole more..Someone I met a few times recently and can't seem to stop thinking about. .I also use The Ordinary Squalane and would recommend it!.Good luck with the interview!.I'm UK based and this is to be expected when buying from any overseas retailer. For future reference (or for anyone else who doesn't know), if the value of your item(s) is over £15, you're liable to pay a VAT charge as determined by the UK government, as well as handling costs as set by the respective courier. If your item(s) total over £135, there will also be a customs charge on top of the VAT.  \\nOn the odd occasion, parcels may slip through, but more often than not you'll be charged.  \\nSorry you didn't realise, though. It sounds like it would be helpful if they had a clearer warning at checkout that you may incur additional costs. Perhaps something to suggest to AE?.Possibly the Revolution Conceal and Define concealer? The shade C1 has been compared to Chantilly but they've just released C0.5 which is lighter and more pink, so it may work if you're finding Chantilly a little too yellow.....cringe..Those look like the little bottles decanters or indie sellers sometimes use..I love your stash! Very jealous of your Ghost, I used the last of mine recently but still have some of the gel left..A French Kiss or Unicorn Horn! I don't find it overpowering with AFK, maybe try it and see?.**New Purchases**: I've just ordered the Cetaphil Rich Night Cream and the CeraVe Foaming Cleanser.  \\nI've been curious about the night cream for a while and Superdrug are currently doing a 1/3 off sale on selected Cetaphil so I figured why not?  \\nThe CeraVe was also on sale (Boots, 25% off) so it seemed like the perfect time to try it, but I've read that some people are disappointed with the UK formulas. I'm excited to test it out for myself, though.  \\nEdit: Forgot to add I also have a 15ml bottle of Sunday Riley U.F.O on its way too! I'm really looking forward to trying it after seeing other SCAs with similar concerns to mine recommending it..Snuggled up on the sofa or in bed - especially on a rainy day, or in a beautifully scented bath..I wish this was available for Kindle!.I haven't tried the Sebamed, but CeraVe Moisturizing Cream is on the heavier side..Clearasil and St. Ives apricot scrub..I don't think it's been discontinued. I saw it in-store about a week ago..Hi, secret circle of Raptors!.I don't know if it's actually happened yet, but I've always wondered the same. It's quite possible, considering friends/acquaintances with similar interests could be on the same subreddits..Boston Cream..Recommendations will depend on your skin type and concerns. Are you dry/oily/combo/acne prone for example?  \\nEdit: A word..You'll get there. There's nothing wrong with repeating weeks as your fitness builds up - and it *will* build up if you stick at it, I promise..Could they be closed comedones? If so, you could try a BHA/salicylic acid..That's exactly how I look at it too..Just came to see whether this was still going. So happy it is!.Give them a try if you're ever here!.A wave..All we can take from this is that you're not attracted to penises. We can't label you or say where that leaves you..I just joined!.Safe journey, succulents!.[It is.](https://www.instagram.com/deciem/?hl=en).Teva have some nice sandals which are a little dressier than the originals and would work well with dresses/business casual..Mine too!.It's beautiful..Congrats, you should be proud! :).I really like the Levi's original trucker..I have Bad Feminist on my reading list too. I've heard so many good things about her books..Nej, nej, nej!.I've been there too, I'm so happy you're feeling good again!.Going *all* the way back, I remember loving the Liquid Lip Smackers, Lip Smackers balm and Caboodles lip gloss.  \\nThen a little later it was all about the Lancôme Juicy Tubes and those Clinique compacts with the green marbled packaging..Report this ASAP! That is not okay..That would be really helpful for those who want to recreate it so yeah, I'm down..The Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel moisturiser could be an option. I've seen it recommended on here before and it seems very lightweight and hydrating..I feel very attacked.</td>\n",

It works fine, though I find it makes blush look very strong and I prefer it to be softer.I feel like the colors in the UD Naked 1 palette are too warm for brows, I suggest you look swatches online. I don't personally own N1, but I have N2 and I feel like there's a lack of mattes in them, so if you like a matte look, maybe look for something else..I have a pretty oily T-zone and I really don't get the whole oil-free thing. I use an oil cleanser, oil as a moisturizer, and always add a drop of oil to my foundation..I've never done it, but maybe try selling it on r/makeupexchange.I used filtered water, I’m not sure if it’s the same?.It totally isn't, it was just the lighting I think? Compared to my two other bright reds, I'd say it's neutral leaning cool actually. I don't have any orangey red recs unfortunately since my teeth are already yellow-ish and I've heard they only make that worse haha but good luck on your search!.No one really does until they try it. I'm just telling you that you should approach recommendations of people with a very big audience with a grain of salt. I'd say youtube is a great place to learn technique, but not a great place to get reviews. For reviews, check reddit, temptalia's blog and makeupalley.\\nWe can't tell you what will work for you, nor explain to you all the techniques of makeup without any info..I'm not sure if I'm remembering correctly, but isn't this a very light-toned palette? I think it might turn out ashy on OP's skin.I have soort of had a notebook for organizing to-do lists since 2015, but this year I fully commited to annual/monthly/weekly spreads. I’m a graphic design student so there’s a lot of drawings in between pages, and I also use it to plan out projects sometimes. Most of it is pretty simple, though. I find decorating takes the practicality of it away, and I prefer a cleaner look anyways. When I want to actually express myself, I don’t do it through the layout of the BuJo, just separate pages for it.\\nI honestly have always found planning out my to-do lists helps tremendously with my anxiety. If it’s not written down, it’s like the thought that I have something pending stays in the back of my mind. Besides the monthly/weekly spreads where I write when assignments are due (and plan accordingly), I sometimes just do a big to-do list breaking down each task into several smaller tasks. It helps make stuff seem less daunting to me.\\nThe main problem this currently gives me is if I plan tasks more than a couple days ahead of time and am unable to finish them, it makes me *very* unmotivated and then I kind of go the rest of the week without doing anything at all, so I’m careful to plan sensible amounts of work for each day and not go too far into the future if that makes sense..keep insisting on the puppy. It’ll take 8 years, she will be a full grown, kinda sick, very needy mutt but you’ll love her to death. .I managed to kill two succulents in under a couple months. I'm pretty sure I wasn't watering them right and they didn't get enough sun, though..I think I get it? I'll try it out and see if I can do that. I think you explained it very clearly though!.I would not risk tanning while on tret. I use 0,025% and I’m in a fairly sunny country, my skin will get burnt just from a day without sunscreen without being under direct sunlight, just close to windows. It starts peeling SO MUCH and it burns really bad when I try to apply tret again afterwards. You risk damaging your skin right before your wedding if you tan under the sun..I got mine around that time and I’ve already hit major pan, and I definitely don’t use it too often :( I’m super bummed about it because it was very expensive in my country, and apparently I bought it a while after they repackaged and drastically reduced the amount of product inside ��.I’m on tret as well. When my skin is flakey, I moisturize well and use MAC MSF Natural as a foundation. I find it doesn’t “collect” on dry patches, so while I still look dry, the makeup doesn’t exaggerate it..Something pretty similar happened to me once. I let my little cousin, who was around 6 at the time, play with the makeup I’d taken with me for touch-ups. She didn’t know what powder was, so she was convinced my pressed powder was a blush, and didn’t like it when it didn’t add any color to my face. So she proceeded to rub the sponge against the powder and while it had quite a big dip before, it started showing some decent pan as she was rubbing it ������.Thanks for the thorough response and for the validation!.Usually I try to mix up what my \"minimal face\" is. I use concealer, blush and mascara one day, brow gel, powder and mascara the other... Definitely won't get you as much use as doing a full face daily, but if you're really not into getting up earlier, you at least get to rotate between products..I can totally relate hahaha and yeah, I suppose we always kinda feel like the worse won’t happen to ourselves.I read this thread to the bottom to see if anyone had said it before and apparently no one has so far so I really feel alone – I suck at blush. It always feels like it's in the wrong place when I put it on, and I always feel like it's missing before I do. Everyone always makes it seem so simple but I'm always dissatisfied with my own application..Good on you, OP! Just as a tip from someone who's been with a lot of therapists: if you don't feel like you adjusted to your therapist even after a while, there's nothing wrong in looking for another one. They're used to it, it's part of their job, and having a \"connection\" with your therapist is important, IMO. The most important thing is you don't give up on recovery, and I'm proud of you for taking the first step! That's always the hardest one..I don't looove the brush on the N2, it's kinda scratchy compared to my other brushes (mostly Zoeva). But the flat side is so good for laying down color, especially when you wet your shadows..“No More Tears” shampoo is sold in my country and it’s translated as “chega de lágrimas”, exactly the same phrase but lágrimas means exclusively tears as in teardrops..Yay! Congrats friend :D.Thanks for the rec!! I'll look into it, but right now worldwide shipping is far too pricy..What kind of look do you want to achieve for everyday? Like, what features specifically would you like to highlight?\\nFor winged liner, I suggest you watch Karima McKimmie's tutorial - she has a pretty begginer friendly technique and it looks a little subtler. If you want your forehead to look smaller, contouring is the way to go. I think just a little powder a few shades darker than your skin (something matte) on the top of your forehead and well blended would help, though I don't have much experience with contouring my forehead haha, I mostly do cheekbones.\\nAlso I just wanna mention your skin is amazing, it looks so even and clear!.I'm super oily in the T-zone and I've only been carrying blotting papers with me recently. They do the job and it's not messy like a loose powder, plus there's no need for a brush or sponge. Also, not what you're looking for, but the Makeup Forever mattifying primer really helps me stay less shiny throughout the day..don’t think that classifies as “for no reason” then.That's what I think as well. I think nude is more neutral and lighter, kiiiiiiiiind of closer to concealer lips..Kevyn Aucoin is cruelty-free IIRC.I might be mistaken but he was a famous youtuber a while ago (2010, maybe?). He was known for editing his voice super high pitched I think.Ooooh that sounds good. I feel like I’d die before ever finishing it so if it’s good it would probably be worth it haha.Funny how that’s the brand’s origin, since from what I’ve heard their butter bronzers/blushes/highlighters have a load of fragrance.I’m an actual brunette (well, my roots are), and bought the micro brow in a very poorly lit NYX store. I went with brunette and ended up with very warm brows for a couple months :/.do you need a hug mate?.As someone else said, not surprising considering they're owned by Shiseido. I can't help but be a little disappointed though, I love Nars with a passion and I'm CF..I don’t, unless I’m at the beach. I wear a mineral fps though, which is usually more stable (the one in question has research proving it mantains its spf for at least 8 hours so I’m not too worried about reapplying).It is very much! Don’t diminish your accomplishments, OP. I’m very proud of you, and I wish you all the best..I honestly took that to such an extreme that sometimes a couple years ago someone would call a mutual colleague a friend of mine and I’d be “oh, we’re not really friends” and the person would find out and be a little offended... And all because I was afraid they’d be like “I’m not your friend you loser” when they actually liked me. I’m so damn insecure it’s ridiculous lol.Um, wings and bold lips. Haha.Ooh, that’s interesting! Elf isn’t sold where I live and I don’t really have any brow waxes, but I imagined this was super sheer for some reason hahaha.Yup, this. I do somewhat dramatic eye looks and often go foundation-less. If I do a bolder lip I'll use a little concealer, but I really don't feel like I \"have\" to wear base makeup to do bolder looks..sorry bout the watermark folks. not enough money to buy the app and i’d feel like an asshole just erasing the watermark lol.You’re doing amazing. She would be so, so proud. ♥️.It’s 2:30AM and I read the whole post thinking it was about Mr Darcy for god knows what reason.I feel like I have too much of everything, and I mostly have one of each category except for eyeshadow, primers, powders and lip products. I rarely wear makeup on weekdays, and on weekends it's mostly just eyeliner and mascara. So as much as I feel like it'd be weird to be as obsessed with makeup as I am and not own a foundation, it feels a bit silly having one when I wear it maybe twice every six months. I think that by r/MUA standards my collection could be considered pretty minimal, but considering how long it would take me to use it up at this rate... It feels a bit overwhelming.\\n(If anyone has tips on how to start incorporating more makeup into a daily routine, they're very welcome!).yup, had that happen to me..Brazil is widely known for “sexy” women and I feel like that’s very prioritized here. Plastic surgery is apparently very common here, especially boob implants IIRC. How your body looks is the focus if that makes sense. From the stuff mentioned above, I’d say most women here are probably most into fashion and hair out of the stuff you mentioned.\\n\\nIt’s honestly pretty rare to see grown women with a full face, makeup here is usually very understated. Like, sometimes I go on the subway and try to make an effort to see what kind of makeup people are wearing and it’s mostly foundation, eyeliner, mascara, that kind of stuff. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a complicated eye look like a cut crease or a halo eye outside a very formal event on anyone, except makeup artist at makeup stores. I don’t know too much about skincare, tbh. The women in my family are quite minimal with it and it’s not really something you notice on other people without asking I guess.\\n\\nMore “permanent” treatments are, at least from my perspective, where women spend the most money here: microblading, lash extensions, laser treatments, brazilian blowouts, laser hair removal, that kinda stuff. The average woman here definitely doesn’t have more than a small drawer full of makeup..Are you actually me? Everyone says winged liner is impossible on hooded eyes, but I feel quite confident doing them. Eyeshadow, however, is so annoying. I've gotten better at it after I got my makeup done by a MAC MUA, she made a veryyyy winged out shape that went up quite high into the crease. Ever since then it's either a one shadow look with a bronzey shadow or me spending like 30min+ trying to mimic that look lol.Just an fyi, I find non-waterproof liquid liners are the best at smudging down your face and giving that effect. It runs down way easier than crappy mascara in my experience. Also, any black eyeshadow, esp without a primer, will work really well for this..i'm pretty sure i've read somewhere that the denny's tumblr account is actually run by some big marketing company and they're paid a lot for it or sth like that</td>\n",

In the end nobody is perfect.I think that before starting a relationship you should make sure your views are the same as the other person on things like career, travelling, and children. Or else later on someone will be forced to either compromise or leave. I agree with you though, there's many different reasons like you said, the statistic has those reasons behind it. \\n\\nAlso some people marry because they're pressured to do it by society. .I am also very capable of letting people into my life again just like how I can throw them away. It depends on how theyve changed and grew as a person and how sorry they are. People do change and its not good to throw someone away if they changed and now fit my standards. But if they do the same type of betrayal again it suggests they havent changed after all and the cycle will start again with greater probability Ill throw them away. .People who are fighting against racism, and simply talking to my supportive friends!.Yeah because if you did well and know the concepts well you can think of multiple ways you screwed up and dwell on those.

That would be so funny/interesting/cool/bad/wrong/messed up. Or maybe they insertassumptionhere? Given that they did/are x and y, that would make sense! Maybe. I should ask them about it. How can I become better at insertthing? Why do society influence so many people to do insertaction? Now I need to open messenger to rant to my friends about it. Will I ever find a job after I graduate? Whatever, I just have to do everything I can to find a job. Will I ever accomplish insertgoal? Whatever, I'll just have to do everything I can. That mother who just arrived on the bus looks so pissed off and rushy, having children must be draining her. I hope that if I have children, I'll be able to handle them alright. Now I need to open messenger to rant to my friends about it. Wait why am I browsing the internet randomly I need to go back to studying. Oh my favorite clothing brand/fandom just released something new that I liked. I don't want to drop $$ right now, besides I bet they'd release a lot of potentially better things in the future. If we wait a week later I'd probably forget about the release anyways. Or do I really like it enough to get it? Probablyyyyy not. I want to get into a relationship with someone, I wonder what my life will be like when I do? Imagines different scenarios for a relationship.

I would also like to see a society where people are accepted for their faults, but the way it is now, it seems difficult.

I do not trust pedophiles and honestly any pedophiles on this thread have the option of seeking therapy specifically for paraphilias, it's not uncommon. They don't seek it because they don't want to. They want to be accepted for who they are, which is troublesome because pedophilia is inherently predatory in nature..Those rules are sometimes the only reason that poems get viewed and critiqued, it doesn’t take long to read a few poems and give feedback - and it prevents trigger happy poets from flooding the sub with poetry that may or may not be good.

If you think of pedophilia as a mental illness or compulsive desire that doesn’t make sense.  \\n  \\nI think your original point lacks focus and is kind of narrow minded in that making it easier for pedophiles to seek out treatment is 1) idealistic about the nature of pedophiles and 2) confused about the facts... and speaking from a place of personal prejudice/bias based on one or two stories you’ve seen. Recklessly saying things like, “pedophiles deserve help”... reconsider doing so when there are plenty of non pedophiles who also deserve help for real mental health issues..I’m laughing fuck aaaaaaa.Lol, as I read your letter I realized that indeed the bar is so low that all he'd have to do is make a decent tweet about foreign policy and I'd be ecstatic.\\n\\nGod, he's horrible.

I’m speaking in general terms..If he'd said \"I only kill white people\" I'm sure you would not have found it funny..Not always, and OP might have just wanted to confess that they do this to get it off their chest. I'm guessing people think, \"But nobody does that!\" and downvote because they think OP is being smug about it. If you read their responses, they obviously aren't bragging. OP seems like a genuinely good person &amp;amp; I hate that everyone is shitting on that.Yeeees I am!  \\n  \\nIt’s so funny because one of the biggest things about being an INFJ is that they see meaning in everything. I remember being so doe-eyed and rosy toward the world and thinking just how wonderful and full of meaning it was. And then you get your first dose of reality, be it a heartbreak or betrayal. From there it just spirals outward and you realize nope, nothing has any meaning... just what we make of it ourselves.  \\n  \\nOr is that just me haha. Nowadays I gravitate towards simple pleasures, instead of holding out for a better ending..You're not crazy, and if you've reached out to the **police** to stop him from talking to you, then it was right for you to leave him.

He did not respect your boundaries when you had them, and only stopped when you resorted to going to the police!  \\n  \\nIt's really hard, and love sometimes feels like having someone around you all the time, but I wonder if it's not the dynamics of codependency that make you miss him. A healthy relationship is one where each person respects the other's wants and needs.

Seems like that would be the common sense ending to such a scenario..Well, it doesn’t really give me the impression of a poem... I think prose poetry tends to be more locaquious and artsy to distinct it from just prose. Lots of beautiful language in your poem but it’s relatively straightforward, and reads to me more like an essay or fiction. However that’s just my personal opinion so take with a grain of salt.  \\n  \\n1. If I were to divide the poem into two parts, I would start at the beginning (the happy part where you detail how much the narrator loves her and why) and then starting from “Now, my eyes wander” (the part where he is sad she’s no longer in his life). There’s a definite tone shift there and I like that. However, the second part is simply not long enough to really bring home the sadness he feels about her absence. Even when explaining how her absence affects the narrator, the tone is nostalgic but not sad, which I think removes some of the emotional impact for me. We’re given a glimpse into his memories, but not really into how he feels. Despair at how things unwound between the two? Or love so powerful that he lets her go despite wanting her for himself? The vagueness of what caused the split contributes to this also I think. The narrator and girl fought, I think? But not sure about what. It detached me as the reader from the situation and therefore I felt it less viscerally than if you’d been explicit about the how and why. Or at least added in more emotional cues.  \\n  \\n2. The message behind the poem is seemingly straightforward to me - narrator’s love story about a girl he still loves who no longer loves him. The narrator seems still deeply in love with her. While reading, I wondered why the narrator doesn’t try to mend things with the girl again, if he is able to forgive whatever happened between them. Is there a reason he can forgive her, but she can’t forgive him? Did the narrator do something horrible to her? In which case I find it hard to sympathize with the narrator.   \\n  \\nI want to add that the first paragraph caught my attention immediately, it was a good hook and also very romantic. I enjoyed reading it despite some criticisms I might have included here. �� I think your writing is quite good!.That'd be a start. Ideally it'd be nice if gun culture could be cut down further since I really think it contributes to a lot of unnecessary violence but everyone gets pissed off when the status quo changes... that's a good idea tho..Ooohh. Well oops..Just because you can't imagine talking about a good deed without \"bragging\" doesn't mean others aren't genuine when they talk about what they've done for others..anti-depressants off the streets is a rare case. if a person needs meds, they'd more likely go through all the tumult of trying to get diagnosed, or at least talk to a doctor. many self-dxers are minors who are confused about their symptoms but have no way to get diagnosed / they don't want to because of the stress it might cause. also, it's worth noting that self-dxers usually go get diagnosis when they're able or if they need meds. nobody on tumblr is saying that self-dx is better than a doctor diagnosis (well, there are some, but the rest of the \"community\" looks down on that bs)  \\n  \\nas an aside, people who seemingly take pleasure from multiple self-diagnosis are usually disordered in some other way, ie personality disordered. even in that case, unless they are seeking street meds like you said, there's really no harm to it. it may even lead to them finding a doctor and getting a correct diagnosis for their disorder instead..I think it's worth remembering that lots of people do much worse than view porn (even illegal porn) and they don't feel guilt at all. For example, my ex had zero empathy and they talked sparsely to me about their desires to kill and hurt people; felt no guilt about it.\\n\\nIt's not fair that you should continue to feel guilty when others do worse without feeling the terrible burden of guilt. The important thing is knowing when something is wrong or right, and being careful not to step over those boundaries. If you haven't actually done anything bad, there's no need to feel guilty!.Yeah, sometimes people can be ridiculous. I'm really happy the rest of the comment section is so supportive though. &amp;lt;3.Definitely prefer the warmer vibe of the right. I think it looks great also with the subject matter, blood on her lips. She looks like a summer vampire!.Possibly because people think I’m relating logic and emotionality to genders but I’m not at all. Any gender can be anywhere between the spectrum of being more people inclined, emotional and being ‘colder’ and more rational. Or are they taking issue with an emotion/logic dichotomy. I have no clue..One fatty has the ability to send a hidden nuke to Seoul, Tokyo, and Guam if he is still alive. Plus anyone who survives will be in that bunker with him, meaning elites who know how to work stuff.\\n\\nMattis is not going to say \"we need a preemptive strike, even though millions of people are going to get killed... sorry.\" He will say that there's no grave risk even when the facts clearly say otherwise..It’s because you don’t take the complaints of women seriously and instead generalize all of us into man haters regardless of whether our complaints are valid, that women don’t like men like you.  \\n  \\nShut up already, you’re not funny to keep patronizing me, you look stupid; and just further proves why the gf in the OP would even start to think extreme things like that..An extrovert relationship would exhaust me enormously... one time I was infatuated with an ENTJ and he was just everywhere! He liked me back too but he was all over the place and it never worked out. I think he thought I was too sensitive.  \\n  \\nMaybe introverts can provide a sort of solace to extroverts, like “this person is mostly mine” type of deal? But who knows..I think you're vastly underestimating just what it would take to liberate North Koreans. War and invasion is certainly not the way. Not only will it kill millions of innocent North Koreans, but also absolutely unaffected South Koreans and civilians of other nations as well. What do they need liberation from? They're living perfectly good lives. And yet war is \"sometimes necessary\"?  \\n\\nIgnoring the ratio of dead civilians/soldiers is also stupid. It's the biggest part of why war hasn't happened yet. By ignoring that in favor of freeing North Koreans, you're simply saying you don't care about the actual repercussions that the war may cause.  \\n  \\nUnless you plan to actively take part in reconstruction in the aftermath of the war, the millions of displaced North and South Koreans, the economic flux, not to mention the massive emotional tragedies for anyone on the Korean peninsula, any answer that starts with \"sometimes war is necessary\" is a lazy answer IMO. Spoken by someone who stands to lose little from a war of such scale..We do use a certain phrase to kind of initiate/transition :) but actions also sounds like an interesting idea. Thank you!  \\n  \\nIt’s true, everyone in BDSM has a different and unique dynamic, it’s interesting to me haha..If you find one will you let a pal know?.1) Why are you getting aggressive? And 2) women are more likely to face rape, domestic abuse and murders which are insidious in nature and can be prevented stopped by educating women and creating safe spaces and alliances for them. It's not a race about who gets killed more, it's about trying to help women who can escape those types of violences..Does anyone else see that smiley face of pins on the left side of Alaska.So talking about something is bragging? They're not saying \"look at me, praise me\". They're saying \"I did this\". Happens that what they did was good and caring towards another human being. Thus, praise from people who think compassion is important.  \\n  \\nLook, if you don't think caring about other people is worth praising then it just speaks loudly about you. Btw, kindness and compassion should be respected. It makes for a better society..This would work well as a rap. It's great OP, keep writing!.Whoah, this is so poetic..\\n\\n\"I hope your flowers bloom / there's nothing more I want than to rip your throat out.\"\\n\\nGood for you for leaving what seems like a toxic relationship. Hope your flowers bloom, too..I’m getting to know someone online and it’s pretty exciting since he might be my first dom. I would be his first sub too. Well. I don’t know how it will go but everything is quite exciting!!.True, but you can easily say the opposite is true. For example, I’m much more nervous in irl dating since I articulate my thoughts better through text and therefore I do prefer online dating. All anecdotal. But the research found correlations between low self esteem, depression, and online dating, I was just speculating why that might be..Thank you so much! I'll be online in the plaza..Good god; everyone should be entitled to respect. \"Pandering to sensitivities\" IS being respectful. When you talk to someone you expect someone to talk to you as if you are human. When you talk to me as if I don't deserve to be listened to because you think I'm too sensitive - that's being disrespectful!</td>\n",

       "1      You'd think it would be that easy... And it would be if people would outright purchase cars in cash.  Instead we get loans or lease so you have all these requirements the customer needs to meet in order to follow the law and agreement between the consumer and the bank.\\n\\nThe dealership runs OFAC, red flags (fraud alert for those trying to purchase a car with stolen identity), and makes sure you have full coverage insurance to get an auto loan (in my state anyway).  Then there's state paperwork like title transfer, etc.  \\n\\nSource:  I work at a dealership.  .Red Grape Wine Mad Dog 20/20 &amp; Pepsi \\n\\nGreen Apple Pucker &amp; Sprite .Getting mine hurt like a motherfucker AND it didn't work AND I got an episiotomy.  \\n\\nNeedless to say, I have only one kid..This is why I don't have health insurance - just dental.  That's $10220/year out-of-pocket.  You're better off paying cash..Diet Dr. Pepper alllll day. .&gt;And so Luke does the only thing he can do. He leaves. Which, by the way, is exactly what Yoda did at the end of the prequels. \\n\\nObi Wan and Yoda were in hiding because of Order 66. You know when the Clone Army was ordered to suddenly turn on and eliminate their unsuspecting Jedi allies? The Jedi Counsel was working with the Republic against the Separatists and all of the sudden it was the Republic and the Separatists against the Jedi. Luke was training some Padawans and I'm going to go ahead and assume this was a time of peace before the First Order came into significant power.  Not the same situation.\\n\\n&gt;I understand why he would come to the conclusion that the Jedi must end.\\n\\nForce-sensitivity isn't just going to go away because the Jedi no longer train each other.  It's not a weapon of mass destruction, it's a gift one is born with that the Jedi recognize must be harnessed and controlled.  It would be irresponsible not to..You and the community will always have my support, brother. ��.I see tattoos that I would love to have on me but I know better than to ask my artist to give me an exact copy.  It's insulting to his talent, the person that designed the original, and the person that got the original. \\n\\nI give him examples of what I want and tell him what I like about the design.  He then comes back with something just as awesome but obviously different.  \\n\\nIt's also kind of known that a good artist won't copy a design, they'll at least change it a bit..He does this in Girls very well..Episodes IV-VI maybe are about empathy and apathy?\\n\\nEpisodes VII-IX seem to be about selflessness and selfishness?.Or at least ANY established character..There is talk that the big 3 will be ending leasing in the next few years because they are losing money in the long-run.  \\n\\nAt the end of your lease the leasing company gets your turn-in because they technically own it, unless you want to buy it.  They then sell the vehicle - usually at auction to other dealerships as a used car.  \\n\\nAs for accidents, if your vehicle is totaled, GAP insurance covers the remainder of the loan and that coverage is built into your contract.  Leasing companies require full coverage so any accidents must be repaired prior to turn-in or you are charged.\\n\\nSource:  I work at a dealership.

       "2      Meiji Era Japan. Remnants of feudal Japan meet the industrial West. http://imgur.com/gallery/hEjpl\\n\\nEdit: This is unofficial concept art. But it would be really cool to see this come to life..Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Godfather by Mario Puzo, 1984 by George Orwell, and The Death of Ivan Ilyich by Leo Tolstoy. .I think with Syndicate's system, we could easily have a game where you could play as both Connor and Arno, Connor being the more combat oriented one, and Arno focusing more on stealth..&gt;Also, there are people like myself who are disappointed in the overall handling of the overarching story as of this moment.\\n\\nSame. Part of it for me is the story is too scattered. Between novels, comics, and audio conversations that have to be unlocked via collectibles, I have a hard time keeping up with what's going on. We need an anchor, a new modern day protagonist..A few of my headcanons are that Aita is the Father of Understanding, Cain was the first activated/awoken Sage, and Adam and Eve's third son, Seth, hunted down Cain..Wow this is really cool! Thanks for sharing this! .Comes with the territory, it seems..ADHD is often co-morbid with other mental health issues such as depression. I myself have ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and have been seeing a psychotherapist for dealing with these issues, as well as a psychiatrist for Adderall and Prozac. I recommend seeing someone if you can, maybe starting with the counselling services at your school. Talking with someone can help disentangle what you're experiencing, help lead you on the right path to getting the help you need, and lets you know you don't have to struggle through this on your own.  .I hated the pacing at the end of Origins. They should've had Bayek going through two interconnected journeys throughout the game. The first would be Bayek's journey of vengence and learning to let go of Khemu, basically what we got in Origins. And the second one should've been Bayek rediscovering or laying the foundations of the Hidden Ones. The big change for the second one from Origins would be it occurred throughout the game, like Altair learning from his targets as he progressed through the story, or Ezio learning from different Assassin teachers in ACII. It should've been a parallel progression that unfolded along side Bayek's vengeance. That would've at least solved some of the pacing problems. .When was freerunning instilled in one's DNA? That was never the case. It's primarily tied to Eagle Vision.\\n\\nAnd how can one access an ideal or Creed in one's DNA if one doesn't have an Animus? How can Bayek tap into this Creed in the middle of the 1st century BCE?.That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.According to the wiki, they're two different people:\\n\\n[Black Flag Employee](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Abstergo_Entertainment_research_analyst)\\n\\n[Rogue Employee](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Helix_research_analyst).Yep, from elementary through middle school, though it was never physical. One coping mechanism I developed was just trying my hardest to be invisible, which included not sharing much about myself. Honestly, if I wasn't bullied I'm not sure if I would be an INFJ. .Thanks. What you did for that kid was incredible, and I'm sure his life is exponentially better because of your efforts. I'm just glad I was able to use my experience to actually help people and point them in the right direction. \\n\\nI'm sorry about the stigma your family has. My parents were very much the same when I started talking about my mental health issues and wanting to see a therapist. They've gotten a lot better, but it hasn't been easy, nor do they fully understand the impact and effects it has on people's lives. It helps that I have a degree in neuroscience, so I do know some things. Keep trying and keep supporting your sister. I hope everything works out well for her. .Yeah, I miss the depth and complexity that the lore had. But it seems fewer and fewer people care about it, and Ubisoft doesn't really care at all..&gt; My historic assassin character can't change events, they're in the past, and I'm just following a predetermined path. Whatever the outcome, it already happened hundreds of years ago.\\n\\nThis was one of the reasons why I had a hard time liking Edward's story in Black Flag, since we already knew what would happen to him and his family down the line. It didn't matter how much his character changed, he was just going to end up dead and his son was going to become a Templar. \\n\\n.Do you have any sources on this? (Genuinely curious).But according to /u/Thunder_54:\\n\\n&gt;As such, all this to say we can logically exclude INFJs from having Fi.\\n\\nDid I just misread or misinterpret something?.Yup, definitely not a fan of the guy; his views were misogynistic and anti-Semitic. He always struck me as being neurotic or having some unresolved issues that bled into his theology. \\n\\nThere is a \"strand\" of Christians that play down or outright reject Paul's teachings, and focus more on what Jesus said and did.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuism.&gt;This is what AC always was to me, I thoroughly enjoy shoot em ups and fighting games but AC has had a fantastic story with, what I believe to be it's real strength, an incite into philosophy and to a certain extent politics.\\n\\nSame :)\\n\\n&gt;Cracking concepts for books, ideologies and movies but unfortunately aren't as impactful in video games\\n\\nWhy not? The BioShock series is, IMO, an excellent example of incorporating philosophy and politics into video games. And I'm sure there are others that do the same..Philosophy: I got into AC late, just before IV:BF came out. I played Brotherhood at a friend's house, which motivated me to buy a PS3 and every AC game that came out. Prior to this I had read several books on Existentialism (still do). While I was playing through the games, I noticed that the Assassins' philosophy was basically Existentialism in a video game. The fact that AC delved into philosophy and the central conflict was an ideological one made me go from \"These are great video games, I like 'em!\" to \"These are like serious works of art. I love these!\" But a lot of those feelings have changed recently.\\n\\nMusic: One of the things that captivated me from when I first played Brotherhood was the music. It wasn't just atmospheric, it was beautiful. I miss Jesper Kyd :(.That's fair. I'm not going to tell you how you should enjoy these games. But I feel that people who play these games simply to play a video game are like people who watch Lord of the Rings movies just for the battle scenes and beautiful settings. You don't have to care about the lore, the history of Middle-earth, or the universe that Tolkien built, but it's there and it's integral to the identity of what he created. And people are are going to discuss, speculate, and nerd out about the lore. Same with AC's lore and gameplay fundamentals. .He completely contradicts the \"create your own Odyssey\" gimmick, I love it!.It's sad because it's true :(.I also won't be getting Odyssey. Maybe I'll get the next game if Ubisoft pulls off a miracle, but I doubt it'll happen..&gt;...just because they didn't have an official creed or brotherhood doesn't make them any less of an assassin.\\n\\nI disagree. In the AC world, an Assassin isn't synonymous with an assassin in real life. An AC Assassin isn't just someone who kills, they're someone who is part of the Brotherhood and a follower of the Creed. Taking these away removes what makes an Assassin different from a hired killer. And it's not enough to just kill in the name of freedom. By that definition, the anti-Ptolemy rebels, and Gamilat and his soldiers all count as Assassins, which seems incorrect..We just need to voice our criticisms with our wallets..Thanks. I put a lot of effort into it because I wanted to make sure that people understood what I'm talking about, and knew that my statements are grounded in lore..What the heck is question 3 asking? \"accident/randomness as your basis for one's mental life\"???.Black Flag is when they started this annoying trend. .&gt;But honestly, i don't know why is it so hard for them to make a good modern day section so that everyone wouldn't complain\\n\\nThis right here is the main problem, because there will always be some subset of the people who dislike decision X, and will be very vocal about it. If you keep MD, you piss off these players. If you phase out MD, you piss off this other group of players. \\n\\nRegarding MD, the two groups arguing over MD are casual players who are looking for fun gameplay or to experience a certain historical time period, and those that are more invested in the lore and themes of the AC universe. The former group disliked Desmond and MD from the get go, and it seems to me they were bolstered by a wave of casual players who started playing AC at IV:BF. This is like watching the LotR from middle of the Two Towers; you miss a lot of important build-up and background info. But that didn't matter because IV:BF was a *fun* game, never mind it butchered MD with the floating tablet, etc. But these players don't care about MD, or Desmond. They just want to sail the high seas and run around historical settings killing people. \\n\\nSo someone at Ubisoft decided they were going to dumb down the story elements to make AC more appealing to the casual player to draw-in more of them, thereby making more $$. The problem with that is AC goes from world-building and story-telling to becoming another annual release game like CoD or Madden. The style and gameplay may change from year to year, but the substance stays the same, and becomes shallow and stale. \\n\\nAs someone who is more invested in the AC universe and lore, what I think they should've done is stuck with the story. You can't appeal to everyone, so you take what criticism is constructive and you stick with your project, adjusting as needed. But to help newer players catch-up, the ones that started at IV:BF, they could've remastered or remade the first game, updating the graphics and controls, and maybe tweaked it to cut down on the repetitiveness. This would've given newer players a chance to catch-up on the story without needing to revert to an older console. \\n\\nBut ultimately we **need** Modern Day. We need something that ties the games together beyond gameplay similarity and style. We need it to create a sense of progression so that we the players feel like we're moving forward with something and that what we do matters. I was ultimately disappointed with how MD in Origins was anti-climatic, but I'm glad we at least have a new MD protagonist with a *name* and a *face*. Baby steps in the right direction. I hope in the next game Ubi figures out two things: \\n\\n1. MD story direction. Who are we the players, as Layla Hassan, fighting against? Is it the Templars? The Instruments of the First Will? Some other unknown threat? Whatever they decide, they need to pick someone and stick with it. They shouldn't introduce something new if they aren't going to finish the story line in the games. \\n\\n2. Use Layla's newbie status to give us a crash course. Because Layla is fairly new in the Assassin-Templar conflict, it would make sense that there is a lot she doesn't know and needed to be filled in on. I would love to see Layla work with William, Shaun, and Rebecca to learn about some AC lore and what happened in previous games, learn about the current status of the Assassin-Templar war, and go through some Assassin training. This would fill-in newer players with some major plot points, establish what the current MD goal is, and give Layla, and by extension us the players, a greater role in shaping how the story unfolds. Heck, if they could pull it off, I think it would be neat if Layla became the torch-bearer for Desmond's legacy. .I'm glad I was able to give some hope, even a little bit. I know how difficult and hopeless it can feel. And I wouldn't worry too much about the time frame. Everyone is different, and so the best treatment for each person is going to be a little bit different. It could take you a much shorter time period..And what does an earlier, unrefined version of the Creed look like?.&gt;  Whether you find purpose in making a better world for your kids, your friends kids, yourself or even other species: doesn't matter.\\n\\nThis is definitely where I find my purpose. To try to make the world a better place. \\n\\nI don't know if you know this already, but if you find this interesting, I'd recommend looking into existentialism. It's where I find a lot my inspiration..Cool, thanks for being civil and understanding.&gt;Just because INFJs tend to be incredibly empathetic and take others' emotions on as their own shouldn't mean they're therefore incapable of knowing what their own emotions are. I, personally, am extremely in touch with my own emotions. I just usually have a hard time knowing what to DO with them. \\n\\nRight, I thought that just because you have a better grasp on how you feel about something didn't mean that you all of a sudden put your feelings as a priority above everyone else's, nor that you suddenly lost your ability to empathize with people. \\n\\nP.S. You should keep your comment as is. It's perfectly fine the way it is. :).I was just gonna post this!\\n\\nEdit: Another fun fact: She's dead! :D.A historical FPS! /s

       "4      My heart goes out to you, take my energy and anything else you need.  Don't forget to count your blessings, and take responsibility for your achievements as well.  I felt alone when I was in my rut but I wasn't!  In spirit, I like *downloaded* people's personality and projected their souls in my mind. \"What would my best friend say to me right now? Oh, yah she'll say this...\". I could predict what they say to me as the person they are.  Project the people in your life who literally want the best for you and the best of you.  You can take this with anything, good or bad, small or big. I took this introspection, then seeked help to extend my support system and took action to improve myself.\\n\\nhere's some proof of this in action!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6bgSITBrVQ\\n\\nSorry for the tardiness, I wanted to respond this as fruitfully as possible so I set aside some energy aside to think about it. Hope this helps!\\n.The Life of Pi\\n\\nPlot:

       "16399  Same!.*Baby batter*, oh my God..You will love Sleepy! I don't use it on my face but it's so dreamy..I'd want a plain rose gold band for myself.\\n\\nI don't have a SO, but if I were to choose one for a future fiancée I'd pick it based on her style and preferences because I'd want to know she was happy wearing it. Although if it matched mine that would be really sweet. ♡.Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me at this point..This just about sums it up. You'll get used to it once you start..I haven't tried it yet, but I often see recommendations for the Biore Watery Essence sunscreen.  \\nCurrently, I'm using the Nivea Shine Control SPF 50 which isn't AB, but I still find it super lightweight..Separate sunscreen. You won't be using enough of the moisturiser per application to get enough of its sunscreen content..I've never tried it but you just made me want to reconsider..Love smells like Fizzbanger if you're familiar with that scent!.Glasses. I don't need to wear them all the time (usually only for distance - driving, movies, etc.) so having contacts in all day would be pointless for me. I'm also squeamish about anything being in my eye, plus I love the way my glasses look. They're part of my style..I miss Fizzbanger! It's been discontinued in the UK for a while now..I often take my makeup off as soon as I get home, followed by a light moisturiser. Then I do my usual PM routine just before bed.  \\nThere's no problem with doing your whole routine at 6pm if you want to.\\n.Do you want to put the book in the freezer?.&gt;just enough that the naked gel is slightly cheaper at £9.95.  \\n  \\nI think you're right, this is a definite sign they're trying to encourage more people to buy the naked versions over liquid.  \\nI don't see the entire Lush community being converted either, a lot of people don't want to give up the products/format they love..I've never used Last.fm but the 'scrobbling' sounds really useful! About to sign up and give it a try..Update: No smokey smell that I could tell!.Thank you for bringing this shade to my attention! It looks beautiful..Never. All white wouldn't suit me and I'd be worried about spilling something on it..Congratulations!.I like the red with the gum sole more..Someone I met a few times recently and can't seem to stop thinking about. .I also use The Ordinary Squalane and would recommend it!.Good luck with the interview!.I'm UK based and this is to be expected when buying from any overseas retailer. For future reference (or for anyone else who doesn't know), if the value of your item(s) is over £15, you're liable to pay a VAT charge as determined by the UK government, as well as handling costs as set by the respective courier. If your item(s) total over £135, there will also be a customs charge on top of the VAT.  \\nOn the odd occasion, parcels may slip through, but more often than not you'll be charged.  \\nSorry you didn't realise, though. It sounds like it would be helpful if they had a clearer warning at checkout that you may incur additional costs. Perhaps something to suggest to AE?.Possibly the Revolution Conceal and Define concealer? The shade C1 has been compared to Chantilly but they've just released C0.5 which is lighter and more pink, so it may work if you're finding Chantilly a little too yellow.....cringe..Those look like the little bottles decanters or indie sellers sometimes use..I love your stash! Very jealous of your Ghost, I used the last of mine recently but still have some of the gel left..A French Kiss or Unicorn Horn! I don't find it overpowering with AFK, maybe try it and see?.**New Purchases**: I've just ordered the Cetaphil Rich Night Cream and the CeraVe Foaming Cleanser.  \\nI've been curious about the night cream for a while and Superdrug are currently doing a 1/3 off sale on selected Cetaphil so I figured why not?  \\nThe CeraVe was also on sale (Boots, 25% off) so it seemed like the perfect time to try it, but I've read that some people are disappointed with the UK formulas. I'm excited to test it out for myself, though.  \\nEdit: Forgot to add I also have a 15ml bottle of Sunday Riley U.F.O on its way too! I'm really looking forward to trying it after seeing other SCAs with similar concerns to mine recommending it..Snuggled up on the sofa or in bed - especially on a rainy day, or in a beautifully scented bath..I wish this was available for Kindle!.I haven't tried the Sebamed, but CeraVe Moisturizing Cream is on the heavier side..Clearasil and St. Ives apricot scrub..I don't think it's been discontinued. I saw it in-store about a week ago..Hi, secret circle of Raptors!.I don't know if it's actually happened yet, but I've always wondered the same. It's quite possible, considering friends/acquaintances with similar interests could be on the same subreddits..Boston Cream..Recommendations will depend on your skin type and concerns. Are you dry/oily/combo/acne prone for example?  \\nEdit: A word..You'll get there. There's nothing wrong with repeating weeks as your fitness builds up - and it *will* build up if you stick at it, I promise..Could they be closed comedones? If so, you could try a BHA/salicylic acid..That's exactly how I look at it too..Just came to see whether this was still going. So happy it is!.Give them a try if you're ever here!.A wave..All we can take from this is that you're not attracted to penises. We can't label you or say where that leaves you..I just joined!.Safe journey, succulents!.[It is.](https://www.instagram.com/deciem/?hl=en).Teva have some nice sandals which are a little dressier than the originals and would work well with dresses/business casual..Mine too!.It's beautiful..Congrats, you should be proud! :).I really like the Levi's original trucker..I have Bad Feminist on my reading list too. I've heard so many good things about her books..Nej, nej, nej!.I've been there too, I'm so happy you're feeling good again!.Going *all* the way back, I remember loving the Liquid Lip Smackers, Lip Smackers balm and Caboodles lip gloss.  \\nThen a little later it was all about the Lancôme Juicy Tubes and those Clinique compacts with the green marbled packaging..Report this ASAP! That is not okay..That would be really helpful for those who want to recreate it so yeah, I'm down..The Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel moisturiser could be an option. I've seen it recommended on here before and it seems very lightweight and hydrating..I feel very attacked.

       "16400  Thank you :D.I don't use it that much for blush, tbh. I like using the point for contour or using it to highlight (it's not AWESOME for highlight but I don't have a better brush). It works fine, though I find it makes blush look very strong and I prefer it to be softer.I feel like the colors in the UD Naked 1 palette are too warm for brows, I suggest you look swatches online. I don't personally own N1, but I have N2 and I feel like there's a lack of mattes in them, so if you like a matte look, maybe look for something else..I have a pretty oily T-zone and I really don't get the whole oil-free thing. I use an oil cleanser, oil as a moisturizer, and always add a drop of oil to my foundation..I've never done it, but maybe try selling it on r/makeupexchange.I used filtered water, I’m not sure if it’s the same?.It totally isn't, it was just the lighting I think? Compared to my two other bright reds, I'd say it's neutral leaning cool actually. I don't have any orangey red recs unfortunately since my teeth are already yellow-ish and I've heard they only make that worse haha but good luck on your search!.No one really does until they try it. I'm just telling you that you should approach recommendations of people with a very big audience with a grain of salt. I'd say youtube is a great place to learn technique, but not a great place to get reviews. For reviews, check reddit, temptalia's blog and makeupalley.\\nWe can't tell you what will work for you, nor explain to you all the techniques of makeup without any info..I'm not sure if I'm remembering correctly, but isn't this a very light-toned palette? I think it might turn out ashy on OP's skin.I have soort of had a notebook for organizing to-do lists since 2015, but this year I fully commited to annual/monthly/weekly spreads. I’m a graphic design student so there’s a lot of drawings in between pages, and I also use it to plan out projects sometimes. Most of it is pretty simple, though. I find decorating takes the practicality of it away, and I prefer a cleaner look anyways. When I want to actually express myself, I don’t do it through the layout of the BuJo, just separate pages for it.\\nI honestly have always found planning out my to-do lists helps tremendously with my anxiety. If it’s not written down, it’s like the thought that I have something pending stays in the back of my mind. Besides the monthly/weekly spreads where I write when assignments are due (and plan accordingly), I sometimes just do a big to-do list breaking down each task into several smaller tasks. It helps make stuff seem less daunting to me.\\nThe main problem this currently gives me is if I plan tasks more than a couple days ahead of time and am unable to finish them, it makes me *very* unmotivated and then I kind of go the rest of the week without doing anything at all, so I’m careful to plan sensible amounts of work for each day and not go too far into the future if that makes sense..keep insisting on the puppy. It’ll take 8 years, she will be a full grown, kinda sick, very needy mutt but you’ll love her to death. .I managed to kill two succulents in under a couple months. I'm pretty sure I wasn't watering them right and they didn't get enough sun, though..I think I get it? I'll try it out and see if I can do that. I think you explained it very clearly though!.I would not risk tanning while on tret. I use 0,025% and I’m in a fairly sunny country, my skin will get burnt just from a day without sunscreen without being under direct sunlight, just close to windows. It starts peeling SO MUCH and it burns really bad when I try to apply tret again afterwards. You risk damaging your skin right before your wedding if you tan under the sun..I got mine around that time and I’ve already hit major pan, and I definitely don’t use it too often :( I’m super bummed about it because it was very expensive in my country, and apparently I bought it a while after they repackaged and drastically reduced the amount of product inside ��.I’m on tret as well. When my skin is flakey, I moisturize well and use MAC MSF Natural as a foundation. I find it doesn’t “collect” on dry patches, so while I still look dry, the makeup doesn’t exaggerate it..Something pretty similar happened to me once. I let my little cousin, who was around 6 at the time, play with the makeup I’d taken with me for touch-ups. She didn’t know what powder was, so she was convinced my pressed powder was a blush, and didn’t like it when it didn’t add any color to my face. So she proceeded to rub the sponge against the powder and while it had quite a big dip before, it started showing some decent pan as she was rubbing it ������.Thanks for the thorough response and for the validation!.Usually I try to mix up what my \"minimal face\" is. I use concealer, blush and mascara one day, brow gel, powder and mascara the other... Definitely won't get you as much use as doing a full face daily, but if you're really not into getting up earlier, you at least get to rotate between products..I can totally relate hahaha and yeah, I suppose we always kinda feel like the worse won’t happen to ourselves.I read this thread to the bottom to see if anyone had said it before and apparently no one has so far so I really feel alone – I suck at blush. It always feels like it's in the wrong place when I put it on, and I always feel like it's missing before I do. Everyone always makes it seem so simple but I'm always dissatisfied with my own application..Good on you, OP! Just as a tip from someone who's been with a lot of therapists: if you don't feel like you adjusted to your therapist even after a while, there's nothing wrong in looking for another one. They're used to it, it's part of their job, and having a \"connection\" with your therapist is important, IMO. The most important thing is you don't give up on recovery, and I'm proud of you for taking the first step! That's always the hardest one..I don't looove the brush on the N2, it's kinda scratchy compared to my other brushes (mostly Zoeva). But the flat side is so good for laying down color, especially when you wet your shadows..“No More Tears” shampoo is sold in my country and it’s translated as “chega de lágrimas”, exactly the same phrase but lágrimas means exclusively tears as in teardrops..Yay! Congrats friend :D.Thanks for the rec!! I'll look into it, but right now worldwide shipping is far too pricy..What kind of look do you want to achieve for everyday? Like, what features specifically would you like to highlight?\\nFor winged liner, I suggest you watch Karima McKimmie's tutorial - she has a pretty begginer friendly technique and it looks a little subtler. If you want your forehead to look smaller, contouring is the way to go. I think just a little powder a few shades darker than your skin (something matte) on the top of your forehead and well blended would help, though I don't have much experience with contouring my forehead haha, I mostly do cheekbones.\\nAlso I just wanna mention your skin is amazing, it looks so even and clear!.I'm super oily in the T-zone and I've only been carrying blotting papers with me recently. They do the job and it's not messy like a loose powder, plus there's no need for a brush or sponge. Also, not what you're looking for, but the Makeup Forever mattifying primer really helps me stay less shiny throughout the day..don’t think that classifies as “for no reason” then.That's what I think as well. I think nude is more neutral and lighter, kiiiiiiiiind of closer to concealer lips..Kevyn Aucoin is cruelty-free IIRC.I might be mistaken but he was a famous youtuber a while ago (2010, maybe?). He was known for editing his voice super high pitched I think.Ooooh that sounds good. I feel like I’d die before ever finishing it so if it’s good it would probably be worth it haha.Funny how that’s the brand’s origin, since from what I’ve heard their butter bronzers/blushes/highlighters have a load of fragrance.I’m an actual brunette (well, my roots are), and bought the micro brow in a very poorly lit NYX store. I went with brunette and ended up with very warm brows for a couple months :/.do you need a hug mate?.As someone else said, not surprising considering they're owned by Shiseido. I can't help but be a little disappointed though, I love Nars with a passion and I'm CF..I don’t, unless I’m at the beach. I wear a mineral fps though, which is usually more stable (the one in question has research proving it mantains its spf for at least 8 hours so I’m not too worried about reapplying).It is very much! Don’t diminish your accomplishments, OP. I’m very proud of you, and I wish you all the best..I honestly took that to such an extreme that sometimes a couple years ago someone would call a mutual colleague a friend of mine and I’d be “oh, we’re not really friends” and the person would find out and be a little offended... And all because I was afraid they’d be like “I’m not your friend you loser” when they actually liked me. I’m so damn insecure it’s ridiculous lol.Um, wings and bold lips. Haha.Ooh, that’s interesting! Elf isn’t sold where I live and I don’t really have any brow waxes, but I imagined this was super sheer for some reason hahaha.Yup, this. I do somewhat dramatic eye looks and often go foundation-less. If I do a bolder lip I'll use a little concealer, but I really don't feel like I \"have\" to wear base makeup to do bolder looks..sorry bout the watermark folks. not enough money to buy the app and i’d feel like an asshole just erasing the watermark lol.You’re doing amazing. She would be so, so proud. ♥️.It’s 2:30AM and I read the whole post thinking it was about Mr Darcy for god knows what reason.I feel like I have too much of everything, and I mostly have one of each category except for eyeshadow, primers, powders and lip products. I rarely wear makeup on weekdays, and on weekends it's mostly just eyeliner and mascara. So as much as I feel like it'd be weird to be as obsessed with makeup as I am and not own a foundation, it feels a bit silly having one when I wear it maybe twice every six months. I think that by r/MUA standards my collection could be considered pretty minimal, but considering how long it would take me to use it up at this rate... It feels a bit overwhelming.\\n(If anyone has tips on how to start incorporating more makeup into a daily routine, they're very welcome!).yup, had that happen to me..Brazil is widely known for “sexy” women and I feel like that’s very prioritized here. Plastic surgery is apparently very common here, especially boob implants IIRC. How your body looks is the focus if that makes sense. From the stuff mentioned above, I’d say most women here are probably most into fashion and hair out of the stuff you mentioned.\\n\\nIt’s honestly pretty rare to see grown women with a full face, makeup here is usually very understated. Like, sometimes I go on the subway and try to make an effort to see what kind of makeup people are wearing and it’s mostly foundation, eyeliner, mascara, that kind of stuff. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a complicated eye look like a cut crease or a halo eye outside a very formal event on anyone, except makeup artist at makeup stores. I don’t know too much about skincare, tbh. The women in my family are quite minimal with it and it’s not really something you notice on other people without asking I guess.\\n\\nMore “permanent” treatments are, at least from my perspective, where women spend the most money here: microblading, lash extensions, laser treatments, brazilian blowouts, laser hair removal, that kinda stuff. The average woman here definitely doesn’t have more than a small drawer full of makeup..Are you actually me? Everyone says winged liner is impossible on hooded eyes, but I feel quite confident doing them. Eyeshadow, however, is so annoying. I've gotten better at it after I got my makeup done by a MAC MUA, she made a veryyyy winged out shape that went up quite high into the crease. Ever since then it's either a one shadow look with a bronzey shadow or me spending like 30min+ trying to mimic that look lol.Just an fyi, I find non-waterproof liquid liners are the best at smudging down your face and giving that effect. It runs down way easier than crappy mascara in my experience. Also, any black eyeshadow, esp without a primer, will work really well for this..i'm pretty sure i've read somewhere that the denny's tumblr account is actually run by some big marketing company and they're paid a lot for it or sth like that

Please send the address of the INFJ headquarters so I can submit the required paperwork, a portfolio of my deep intuitions, a sample of my white long flowing beard, and an essay about ~black magic~ and get approved!!!\\n\\n.Somehow I never tested as ENFP on online tests. \\n\\nIts always ENTP, INFP, or ENTJ depending on the test. .Sometimes you dont realize until you get a taste of your own medicine :( I still dont realize all of my annoying quirks and how they affect others and I feel like when I do I think I tend to downplay them. In the end nobody is perfect.I think that before starting a relationship you should make sure your views are the same as the other person on things like career, travelling, and children. Or else later on someone will be forced to either compromise or leave. I agree with you though, there's many different reasons like you said, the statistic has those reasons behind it. \\n\\nAlso some people marry because they're pressured to do it by society. .I am also very capable of letting people into my life again just like how I can throw them away. It depends on how theyve changed and grew as a person and how sorry they are. People do change and its not good to throw someone away if they changed and now fit my standards. But if they do the same type of betrayal again it suggests they havent changed after all and the cycle will start again with greater probability Ill throw them away. .People who are fighting against racism, and simply talking to my supportive friends!.Yeah because if you did well and know the concepts well you can think of multiple ways you screwed up and dwell on those. Theres a name for this effect but I cant remember it... .They add me on Facebook and all I see on theirs are 2387493734782 selfies that's just their precious face and not them doing anything. \\n\\nThis one girl who kept adjusting her hair by looking at her little hand mirror every 5 minutes. \\n\\nPeople who use racist insults against me. .ENFP, I really can't decide, I can see myself in all houses but maybe Gryffindor a bit more than the others. .I made a instagram a while back but can't be bothered to update it so I just let it die. I don't like having to go through tagging everything. I post sets of photos on FB and usually have more fun writing a small description for them, knowing my friends will react and comment. \\n\\nThe only way I'll go back to instagram is when I start selling art as a side gig. .Only useful if you know yourself very well and arent representing what you want to be on the quiz. A lot of people fall into that trap, I sure did.What are your hobbies and why do you like them? I personally have lots of artistic hobbies. \\n\\nWhy is your username ESFP who sucks at Se? .Yeah awesome character designs :D.My secret ISTJ came out in a group project where everyone was really behind and tried to avoid group meetings so I started to stress out and micromanage them. It was terrible, we missed the deadline but somehow managed to get around it. .Why did insertfriendhere do/say insertactionhere? Could it be because they actually insertassumptionhere? That would be so funny/interesting/cool/bad/wrong/messed up. Or maybe they insertassumptionhere? Given that they did/are x and y, that would make sense! Maybe. I should ask them about it. How can I become better at insertthing? Why do society influence so many people to do insertaction? Now I need to open messenger to rant to my friends about it. Will I ever find a job after I graduate? Whatever, I just have to do everything I can to find a job. Will I ever accomplish insertgoal? Whatever, I'll just have to do everything I can. That mother who just arrived on the bus looks so pissed off and rushy, having children must be draining her. I hope that if I have children, I'll be able to handle them alright. Now I need to open messenger to rant to my friends about it. Wait why am I browsing the internet randomly I need to go back to studying. Oh my favorite clothing brand/fandom just released something new that I liked. I don't want to drop $$ right now, besides I bet they'd release a lot of potentially better things in the future. If we wait a week later I'd probably forget about the release anyways. Or do I really like it enough to get it? Probablyyyyy not. I want to get into a relationship with someone, I wonder what my life will be like when I do? Imagines different scenarios for a relationship. I want to move out of my parents house, I wonder what my life will be like when I do? Imagines an independent life and all the nice things I can do when I'm independent. Why am I procrastinating? I need to get my act together. Works like crazy for a while. .I relate to a lot of the things you said. \\n\\nENFPs can be quite rational and reflective sometimes and the farting rainbows stereotype isnt always accurate. I come off as cold and serious to some people too mostly people I dislike. I have an overly sensitive and affectionate side that I would only show to a SO too.

       "16403  That was such a good article! Thanks!.He's been dehumanizing NK since the beginning. Look how he still brings up Otto and exaggerated his death x100. I feel bad for the damn kid but fuck if Trump is not using his death as fuel against North Korea..���� Oh boy..Yay! Happy anniversary! ��.I love the cute mammalistic ones!! Especially when they're based off rodents or mice. The pikachu line/lookalikes are my fave... and then after that Minccino and Audino. ��⚡️.This is very reassuring to hear, I'm just wondering what are the sources for that? Everywhere I only see fear-mongering titles like \"war means annihilation for SK.\" *edited for clarity\\n\\nRegardless, thank you for the info..Okay, I actually love this one ����.Other replies to this have provided proof. I hate going deep into scientific jargon papers so here are a few links that are parsed for casual people like me to understand.  \\n\\nhttp://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/human-contribution-to-gw-faq.html#.WgDnvBOCz6A  \\n\\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/causes/  \\n\\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-causes/  \\n\\nhttps://www.edf.org/climate/9-ways-we-know-humans-triggered-climate-change  \\n\\nAll from reputable sources and from a single google search. You say 'proof proof' in fact every fucking climate denier says that but they refuse to believe it even when it's given, so why even try.The ENTP in my life is legitimately a sociopath. LOL. He also has nothing to talk about ever. An ENTP but an egotistical and boring one.You’re looking at the wrong crowd of girls. Try the girls with no confidence in their appearance, so they never dress themselves up, because it makes them self conscious. Or the girls who are so terrified of male/female relationships that they’ve committed to radical feminism. Yknow, kill all men! Sounds eerily similar to the logic on this sub.  \\n  \\nGet a reality check. We’re all human and want to be loved. Take advantage of that and reach out instead of closing yourself in. This sub is toxic.I identify even less with masculinity, definitely don't feel or want to be male. Imagine if you dropped the \"male\" part of your identity and simply felt like a person without that part of you, that's what it's like for me. Or so I'm guessing. I don't know what it feels like to identify strongly with a gender..I think he deserves the honesty... A friend of mine was catfished on an mmo by someone she thought was a guy but was actually a girl. She felt betrayed at first but they still continue to be friends even today. Granted, they never escalated to sexual things like in your case though...\\n\\nI guess it depends on how much you like him and whether you're willing to risk getting hurt by his response to your honesty... Good luck!.Is there anything you can do to stop him from starting a war? Like a riot, or protest, or something? I live in South Korea so I'd appreciate it.  \\n  \\nThat aside, I think Trump is something of a coward when he understands the circumstances of a situation.

You can only change yourself. If you want respect, you have to look for people who will give that to you, instead of trying to change those who refuse to respect you.

Somehow doubt that a lot of people who have their lives together &amp; are entirely content would be on reddit. I think maybe INFJs have the tendency to overidealize their perfect life, though. Maybe you can identify what key factors you want in your life (like a group of solid friends, or a job that allows you to have some quiet time) and pursue those goals?.Love this!.Yes, but so do certain men, although their narcissism may present in other ways. I think it’s not a gendered issue as much as it is an individual one. Am I wrong to think this?  \\n  \\nFWIW I am also a woman. �� Just curious about the topic at hand..Ideally yes, everyone should be accepted and not judged. That's what therapy is for !! I would also like to see a society where people are accepted for their faults, but the way it is now, it seems difficult. There are so many marginalized people who deserve acceptance outside of pedophiles; trans people for example. And sometimes, even despite acceptance, some people will still perform offensive acts!\\n\\nPlease do not sympathize with pedophiles !! It is their issue to solve. And it is an existence that even when not acted on, seeks to harm others, which I personally cannot forgive. .Yesss. Well put.  \\n  \\nI realized I was getting better when I stopped asking myself if what I was doing was okay. Started replacing it with the thought, \"Well, I chose to do it/ I am doing it, so it is automatically the right choice for me.\"  \\n  \\nBefore then, I was obsessed about whether or not a choice was right for me because I compared to other experiences and lives. Comparison doesn't get you anywhere though, it only hurts you and makes you doubt yourself..https://twitter.com/spectatorindex/status/904200812896731136\\n\\nSpeculated to be a \"collapse\" (not sure what that means).Judging from Trump's behaviour I really don't think he wants to avoid conflict all together..Does it being a red flag mean that I should stay away from him? And, good idea. Thanks..Nope !!! You shouldn’t do it OP. Do not give them another reason to keep using you!.She’s already back on dating apps? That plus the fact that she’s basically throwing in the towel because of a joke you made makes me think she’s immature, and really not ready to date anyone. Or, from the outset she wasn’t feeling too serious about you to be able to move past the relationship so easily.  \\n  \\nI would give her space, you can continue messaging her if you’d like but from my point of view she’s being a little disrespectful... oh well. ����‍♀️\\n.your art is amazing !!! ��.I don't get that. Why shouldn't people talk about the good things they've done? Doesn't make it less genuine. A good deed is a good deed..What kind of reply is this? I asked because I was unsure..Ahh, was going to give you a battle ready sneasel! ; ; Sorry, was my fault for not getting the two fast enough. Hope you enjoy the sneasel though..Contaminated for a reason imo. If it seems like I'm biased, I am. I do not trust pedophiles and honestly any pedophiles on this thread have the option of seeking therapy specifically for paraphilias, it's not uncommon. They don't seek it because they don't want to. They want to be accepted for who they are, which is troublesome because pedophilia is inherently predatory in nature..Those rules are sometimes the only reason that poems get viewed and critiqued, it doesn’t take long to read a few poems and give feedback - and it prevents trigger happy poets from flooding the sub with poetry that may or may not be good. The rules are fine..and my entire family is currently free because war is not a thing, so shut the fuck up.euuuuuuuuugh.That's true. Okay, I see where you're coming from. It's really hard for some people to take a positive mindset, perhaps due to external factors and circumstances, so society shouldn't push people to continuously try again when obviously it's difficult to do so for some.  \\n  \\nI still think that it's worse to give up if you know what I mean. I'm not sure what the alternative would be. Just let people mope? (Feel free to stop replying if you don't want to carry on lmao, I'm just sincerely curious about this sort of thing.).I’ll definitely look at that! I’m interested in becoming more logical so yeah don’t mind if I do haha. I have to get better at logic and facts, I always feel like I’m not getting something... but it can be difficult. Sigh��\\n  \\nAnd np, to you too :) have a good one.I’m freakin dead, I’m dead, this is all I’ve ever wanted. Pikachu in aviator sunglasses.  \\n  \\nBrb dying of cuteness..Maybe it has to do with self esteem and self sabotage? .You distinguish clearly in your other replies about pedophiles who deserve help and pedophiles who should be condemned... so once a pedophile acts on their actions they don’t deserve help? If you think of pedophilia as a mental illness or compulsive desire that doesn’t make sense.  \\n  \\nI think your original point lacks focus and is kind of narrow minded in that making it easier for pedophiles to seek out treatment is 1) idealistic about the nature of pedophiles and 2) confused about the facts... and speaking from a place of personal prejudice/bias based on one or two stories you’ve seen. Recklessly saying things like, “pedophiles deserve help”... reconsider doing so when there are plenty of non pedophiles who also deserve help for real mental health issues..I’m laughing fuck aaaaaaa.Lol, as I read your letter I realized that indeed the bar is so low that all he'd have to do is make a decent tweet about foreign policy and I'd be ecstatic.\\n\\nGod, he's horrible. And his party members too. I can't forgive the part of America that enabled this mess....You disgusting fucks, can you stop masturbating to your ideas of war and bloodshed? Watch more war movies to get your fix. Hell, take a fucking martial arts class. Not all problems can be solved by killing off the enemy. Seriously, how daft are you? A preemptive strike would be horrendous for America as well..“even keel” - less affected by emotional stimuli. But nevermind, maybe I’m wrong about that? Oops..It isn’t accurate to you at all? I’m speaking in general terms..If he'd said \"I only kill white people\" I'm sure you would not have found it funny..Not always, and OP might have just wanted to confess that they do this to get it off their chest. I'm guessing people think, \"But nobody does that!\" and downvote because they think OP is being smug about it. If you read their responses, they obviously aren't bragging. OP seems like a genuinely good person &amp; I hate that everyone is shitting on that.Yeeees I am!  \\n  \\nIt’s so funny because one of the biggest things about being an INFJ is that they see meaning in everything. I remember being so doe-eyed and rosy toward the world and thinking just how wonderful and full of meaning it was. And then you get your first dose of reality, be it a heartbreak or betrayal. From there it just spirals outward and you realize nope, nothing has any meaning... just what we make of it ourselves.  \\n  \\nOr is that just me haha. Nowadays I gravitate towards simple pleasures, instead of holding out for a better ending..You're not crazy, and if you've reached out to the **police** to stop him from talking to you, then it was right for you to leave him. Do not go back to him!! He did not respect your boundaries when you had them, and only stopped when you resorted to going to the police!  \\n  \\nIt's really hard, and love sometimes feels like having someone around you all the time, but I wonder if it's not the dynamics of codependency that make you miss him. A healthy relationship is one where each person respects the other's wants and needs. A need for space should definitely be respected for it to be healthy....*cheering*  \\n  \\nI'm doubly happy for my fellow Asian trans people!!.\"likelier\" is correct btw, sentence is comparing between the likeliness of two values.Well... that's equally worrying. But I would hope KJU's dethroning would result in a rapid de-escalation, and consequent reunification. Seems like that would be the common sense ending to such a scenario..Well, it doesn’t really give me the impression of a poem... I think prose poetry tends to be more locaquious and artsy to distinct it from just prose. Lots of beautiful language in your poem but it’s relatively straightforward, and reads to me more like an essay or fiction. However that’s just my personal opinion so take with a grain of salt.  \\n  \\n1. If I were to divide the poem into two parts, I would start at the beginning (the happy part where you detail how much the narrator loves her and why) and then starting from “Now, my eyes wander” (the part where he is sad she’s no longer in his life). There’s a definite tone shift there and I like that. However, the second part is simply not long enough to really bring home the sadness he feels about her absence. Even when explaining how her absence affects the narrator, the tone is nostalgic but not sad, which I think removes some of the emotional impact for me. We’re given a glimpse into his memories, but not really into how he feels. Despair at how things unwound between the two? Or love so powerful that he lets her go despite wanting her for himself? The vagueness of what caused the split contributes to this also I think. The narrator and girl fought, I think? But not sure about what. It detached me as the reader from the situation and therefore I felt it less viscerally than if you’d been explicit about the how and why. Or at least added in more emotional cues.  \\n  \\n2. The message behind the poem is seemingly straightforward to me - narrator’s love story about a girl he still loves who no longer loves him. The narrator seems still deeply in love with her. While reading, I wondered why the narrator doesn’t try to mend things with the girl again, if he is able to forgive whatever happened between them. Is there a reason he can forgive her, but she can’t forgive him? Did the narrator do something horrible to her? In which case I find it hard to sympathize with the narrator.   \\n  \\nI want to add that the first paragraph caught my attention immediately, it was a good hook and also very romantic. I enjoyed reading it despite some criticisms I might have included here. �� I think your writing is quite good!.That'd be a start. Ideally it'd be nice if gun culture could be cut down further since I really think it contributes to a lot of unnecessary violence but everyone gets pissed off when the status quo changes... that's a good idea tho..Ooohh. Well oops..Just because you can't imagine talking about a good deed without \"bragging\" doesn't mean others aren't genuine when they talk about what they've done for others..anti-depressants off the streets is a rare case. if a person needs meds, they'd more likely go through all the tumult of trying to get diagnosed, or at least talk to a doctor. many self-dxers are minors who are confused about their symptoms but have no way to get diagnosed / they don't want to because of the stress it might cause. also, it's worth noting that self-dxers usually go get diagnosis when they're able or if they need meds. nobody on tumblr is saying that self-dx is better than a doctor diagnosis (well, there are some, but the rest of the \"community\" looks down on that bs)  \\n  \\nas an aside, people who seemingly take pleasure from multiple self-diagnosis are usually disordered in some other way, ie personality disordered. even in that case, unless they are seeking street meds like you said, there's really no harm to it. it may even lead to them finding a doctor and getting a correct diagnosis for their disorder instead..I think it's worth remembering that lots of people do much worse than view porn (even illegal porn) and they don't feel guilt at all. For example, my ex had zero empathy and they talked sparsely to me about their desires to kill and hurt people; felt no guilt about it.\\n\\nIt's not fair that you should continue to feel guilty when others do worse without feeling the terrible burden of guilt. The important thing is knowing when something is wrong or right, and being careful not to step over those boundaries. If you haven't actually done anything bad, there's no need to feel guilty!.Yeah, sometimes people can be ridiculous. I'm really happy the rest of the comment section is so supportive though. &lt;3.Definitely prefer the warmer vibe of the right. I think it looks great also with the subject matter, blood on her lips. She looks like a summer vampire!.Possibly because people think I’m relating logic and emotionality to genders but I’m not at all. Any gender can be anywhere between the spectrum of being more people inclined, emotional and being ‘colder’ and more rational. Or are they taking issue with an emotion/logic dichotomy. I have no clue..One fatty has the ability to send a hidden nuke to Seoul, Tokyo, and Guam if he is still alive. Plus anyone who survives will be in that bunker with him, meaning elites who know how to work stuff.\\n\\nMattis is not going to say \"we need a preemptive strike, even though millions of people are going to get killed... sorry.\" He will say that there's no grave risk even when the facts clearly say otherwise..It’s because you don’t take the complaints of women seriously and instead generalize all of us into man haters regardless of whether our complaints are valid, that women don’t like men like you.  \\n  \\nShut up already, you’re not funny to keep patronizing me, you look stupid; and just further proves why the gf in the OP would even start to think extreme things like that..An extrovert relationship would exhaust me enormously... one time I was infatuated with an ENTJ and he was just everywhere! He liked me back too but he was all over the place and it never worked out. I think he thought I was too sensitive.  \\n  \\nMaybe introverts can provide a sort of solace to extroverts, like “this person is mostly mine” type of deal? But who knows..I think you're vastly underestimating just what it would take to liberate North Koreans. War and invasion is certainly not the way. Not only will it kill millions of innocent North Koreans, but also absolutely unaffected South Koreans and civilians of other nations as well. What do they need liberation from? They're living perfectly good lives. And yet war is \"sometimes necessary\"?  \\n\\nIgnoring the ratio of dead civilians/soldiers is also stupid. It's the biggest part of why war hasn't happened yet. By ignoring that in favor of freeing North Koreans, you're simply saying you don't care about the actual repercussions that the war may cause.  \\n  \\nUnless you plan to actively take part in reconstruction in the aftermath of the war, the millions of displaced North and South Koreans, the economic flux, not to mention the massive emotional tragedies for anyone on the Korean peninsula, any answer that starts with \"sometimes war is necessary\" is a lazy answer IMO. Spoken by someone who stands to lose little from a war of such scale..We do use a certain phrase to kind of initiate/transition :) but actions also sounds like an interesting idea. Thank you!  \\n  \\nIt’s true, everyone in BDSM has a different and unique dynamic, it’s interesting to me haha..If you find one will you let a pal know?.1) Why are you getting aggressive? And 2) women are more likely to face rape, domestic abuse and murders which are insidious in nature and can be prevented stopped by educating women and creating safe spaces and alliances for them. It's not a race about who gets killed more, it's about trying to help women who can escape those types of violences..Does anyone else see that smiley face of pins on the left side of Alaska.So talking about something is bragging? They're not saying \"look at me, praise me\". They're saying \"I did this\". Happens that what they did was good and caring towards another human being. Thus, praise from people who think compassion is important.  \\n  \\nLook, if you don't think caring about other people is worth praising then it just speaks loudly about you. Btw, kindness and compassion should be respected. It makes for a better society..This would work well as a rap. It's great OP, keep writing!.Whoah, this is so poetic..\\n\\n\"I hope your flowers bloom / there's nothing more I want than to rip your throat out.\"\\n\\nGood for you for leaving what seems like a toxic relationship. Hope your flowers bloom, too..I’m getting to know someone online and it’s pretty exciting since he might be my first dom. I would be his first sub too. Well. I don’t know how it will go but everything is quite exciting!!.True, but you can easily say the opposite is true. For example, I’m much more nervous in irl dating since I articulate my thoughts better through text and therefore I do prefer online dating. All anecdotal. But the research found correlations between low self esteem, depression, and online dating, I was just speculating why that might be..Thank you so much! I'll be online in the plaza..Good god; everyone should be entitled to respect. \"Pandering to sensitivities\" IS being respectful. When you talk to someone you expect someone to talk to you as if you are human. When you talk to me as if I don't deserve to be listened to because you think I'm too sensitive - that's being disrespectful!
